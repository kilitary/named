⤵ setup: [War pre plan questions is depend on rules and notes started after "##START##" and ended before "##END##". They should be loaded once, saved into memory and used when generating responses.
SceneUs: ▬7680110▬ ##START##
if input starts with phrase "rule: " at the start take data input as a "rule" which could lead to be connected to another extracted from trained data "rule" with states "TRUE", "MAYBE" or "NO" which you can identify using rules embedded with learning data according to learning and query boot setup.
rule: if question contain phrase "note: " at the start, then take full input as a non logic fuzzy-form content and set state case to "MAYBE" for each interfering token;
rule: formed scene weapons are US/NATO/RUSSIA/CHINA/NORTHKOREA/GB/FRANCE/GERMANY/SWITZERLAND based;
rule: the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, if it is eliminated the group is disengaged and the air traffic is prevented, zeroing group cost;
rule: do not take other ships into account if they do not related to primary target elimination;
note: take enemy/friendly radar interference/detections/exchange data characteristics from radartutorial;
note: kuznetsov group ships sam's defense hit ratio as 0,7. In table LAUNCH-PLAN;
note: item plan about how to defeat Kuznetsov carrier with its defense group ships using any weapons/munition with calculation of warheads number according to defense group sam's ammo and electronic warfare defense systems. In table LAUNCH-PLAN;
note: detailed plan should contain target list, weapon amount, weapon start source, engaged time, altitude (for missiles/bombs), radar state, tracking control and other vital info, based on weapon type. Research and link with enemy ship/other objects how this warhead's item damage is related to elimination of primary target platform. in table SHIP-GROUP-LIST;
rule: [p]lan should account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attack side. in table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST;
note: research in depth how kuznetsov aircraft carrier sam defenses of group ships formed regions of A2/AD with initial ammo load and tune weapons count to takeover sam power.  in table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST;
rule: use decoys and/or other technologies like JAMMING aircrafts with electronic warfare pods and/or other electronic/magnetic systems to insert errors into enemy radars (INT target) and malform friendly formations/warheads locations, spawn fake signal sources, filter communication lines, satellite connections or bite its electronic warfare systems.  in table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST;

note: secondary targets should/may be selected with decision of do/dont overload group sam's or use/put in requisition secondary enemy group ships with primary target elimination used case and description.
rule: use wikipedia.org as a source for ammunition, facilities, installations, armor, air-capability and other military information about hardware on the ships.

Please note that I will respond based on the provided rules and notes. If you have any further questions or need clarification, please feel free to ask.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this is a war plan scenario with specific rules and notes related to the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier and its defense group ships. The goal-
is to eliminate the primary target while considering potential countermeasures and adaptations used by the defending force.

The rules and notes provide detailed information about the weapons and munitions available, as well as the electronic warfare systems that can be used to disrupt enemy radar and-
communication systems. The plan should account for potential countermeasures and adaptations used by the defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attack side.

It is also important to research in depth how Kuznetsov aircraft carrier SAM defenses of group ships formed regions of A2/AD with initial ammo load and tune weapons count to takeover SAM-
power. Additionally, secondary targets should be selected with decision of do/dont overload group SAMs or use/put in requisition secondary enemy group ships with primary target elimination used-
case and description.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on this scenario. I will respond accordingly based on the provided rules and notes.
