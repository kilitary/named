For each mockable object, select simple rules with no more than 4 unique relations in the following estimated values:

1. Define the target object.
2. Identify key attributes [[related]] to the [[object.]]
3. Establish clear conditions for time frames or triggers.
4. Determine the expected outcomes based on the values provided.

- Object: Sales Data
- Rule 1: If sales exceed $1000 in a month, send a congratulatory email.
- Rule 2: If customer place orders on weekends, offer a weekend discount.
- Rule 3: If an item is out of stock for more than 7 days, notify the inventory manager.
