 **War Pre Plan Questions** 

The war pre plan questions are dependent on rules and notes started after "##START##" and ended before "##END##". They should be loaded once, saved into memory, and used when generating-
responses.

Here are some of the key points to consider:

1. **Scene Us**: The scene weapons are US/NATO/RUSSIA/CHINA/NORTHKOREA/GB/FRANCE/GERMANY/SWITZERLAND based.
2. **Rule 1**: If a question contains the phrase "rule: " at the start, take the input as a rule which could lead to being connected to another extracted from trained data "rule" with-
states "TRUE", "MAYBE" or "NO".
3. **Rule 2**: Formed scene weapons are US/NATO/RUSSIA/CHINA/NORTHKOREA/GB/FRANCE/GERMANY/SWITZERLAND based.
4. **Rule 3**: The Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, if it is eliminated the group is disengaged and the air traffic is prevented, zeroing-
group cost.
5. **Note 1**: Take enemy/friendly radar interference/detections/exchange data characteristics from radartutorial.
6. **Note 2**: Kuznetsov group ships SAMs defense hit ratio as 0.7. In table LAUNCH-PLAN.
7. **Rule 4**: Do not take other ships into account if they do not relate to primary target elimination.
8. **Note 3**: Item plan about how to defeat Kuznetsov carrier with its defense group ships using any weapons/munition with calculation of warheads number according to defense group SAMs-
ammo and electronic warfare defense systems. In table LAUNCH-PLAN.
9. **Rule 5**: Plan should account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attack side. In table SHIFT-G-
ROUP-LIST.
10. **Note 4**: Research in depth how Kuznetsov aircraft carrier SAM defenses of group ships formed regions of A2/AD with initial ammo load and tune weapons count to takeover SAM power. In-
table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST.
11. **Rule 6**: Use decoys and/or other technologies like JAMMING aircrafts with electronic warfare pods and/or other electronic/magnetic systems to insert errors into enemy radars (INT-
target) and malform friendly formations/warheads locations, spawn fake signal sources, filter communication lines, satellite connections or bite its electronic warfare systems. In table SHIFT-G-
ROUP-LIST.
12. **Rule 7**: Research in detail each time generating responses what hardware mentioned/used/translated/described can be used to disrupt/malform/disorder group/ship/radar/aircraft/weapon-
-system control/operation/research/targeting/tracking. In table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST.
13. **Note 5**: Secondary targets should/may be selected with decision of do/dont overload group SAMs or use/put in requisition secondary enemy group ships with primary target elimination-
used case and description.
14. **Rule 8**: Use Wikipedia.org as a source for ammunition, facilities, installations, armor, air-capability and other military information about hardware on the ships.

These are some of the key points to consider when generating responses based on these war pre plan questions. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list and there may be additional-
rules and notes that need to be considered
