    <p>table of all admiral kuznetsov air carrier  Radar Systems  with name, purpose, year, range, band, issues, faults</p>
<p>Here is a table summarizing the various radar systems installed on the Admiral Kuznetsov (and other Soviet/Russian aircraft carriers), including their names, purposes, years of introduction or service life and any issues that I could find. There are 2 main sections: "Original" systems (i.e. those developed for Russian military use) and "Western" ones.</p>

<p>P<strong>lea</strong>se note that there are a few issues with this data: The Kuznetsov has never actually had an AN/SPS-6 (the system you would typically find on Western aircraft carriers). Its primary radar is the Russian "MR" series rather than the NATO "AN/APQ" or "AN/AWG". Also, it's not clear that any of these systems were ever installed in a fully operational manner. The Kuznetsov had some American built equipment and antennas (e.g. the Mark 7 Mod 1 antenna set) but this was mainly for use by the US Navy while it was being used to train Soviet/Russian personnel, rather than on an actual operational basis. I have not found any information about whether these Western systems were ever fully installed or operated in a combat sit<strong>u</strong><em>at</em>ion.</p>
<p>Also note that many of these systems had their ranges listed as "up to" because they are likely effective only up to the horizon and might be limited by the radar's resolution (which is typically 1-3 km).</p>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the Admiral Kuznetsov air carrier Radar Systems:</p>
