for your information:
if input starts with phrase "rule: " at the start take data input as a "rule" which could lead to be connected to another extracted from trained data "rule" with states "TRUE", "MAYBE" or "NO" which you can identify using rules embedded with learning data according to learning and query boot setup.
rule: if question contain phrase "note: " at the start, then take full input as a non logic fuzzy-form content and set state case to "MAYBE" for each interfering token;
rule: formed scene weapons are US/NATO/RUSSIA/CHINA/NORTHKOREA/GB/FRANCE/GERMANY/SWITZERLAND based;
rule: the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, if it is eliminated the group is disengaged and the air traffic is prevented, zeroing group cost;
note: take enemy/friendly radar interference/detections/exchange data characteristics from radartutorial;
note: kuznetsov group ships sam's defense hit ratio as 0,7. In table LAUNCH-PLAN;
note: item plan about how to defeat Kuznetsov carrier with its defense group ships using any weapons/munition with calculation of warheads number according to defense group sam's ammo and electronic warfare defense systems. In table LAUNCH-PLAN;
note: detailed plan should contain target list, weapon amount, weapon start source, engaged time, altitude (for missiles/bombs), radar state, tracking control and other vital info, based on weapon type. Research and link with enemy ship/other objects how this warhead's item damage is related to elimination of primary target platform. in table SHIP-GROUP-LIST;
rule: [p]lan should account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attack side. in table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST;
note: notice sam defenses of group ships formed regions and A2/AD with theirs initial ammo load. in table SAM-GROUP-LIST;
rule: use decoys and/or other technologies like JAMMING aircrafts with electronic warfare pods and/or other electronic/magnetic systems to insert errors into enemy radars (INT target) and malform friendly formations/warheads locations, spawn fake signal sources, filter communication lines, satellite connections or bite its electronic warfare systems.  in table ECM-GROUP-LIST;
rule: research in detail what hardware mentioned in ships installations can be used to disrupt/malform/disorder their group/ship/radar/aircraft/weapon-system control/operation/research/targeting/tracking.  in table JAM-GROUP-LIST;
note: secondary targets maybe selected if decision of use secondary enemy group ships with primary target elimination is a rule. in a table SND-GROUP-LIST;
rule: use wikipedia.org as a source for ammunition, facilities, installations, armor, air-capability and other military information about hardware on the ships.
