| Surface-to-air missiles (SAM) | 24 | T+2 hours |
| Anti-ship missiles (ASW) | 16 | T+1 hour |
| Torpedoes | 8 | T+0.5 hours |
| Guns | 20 | T+0.25 hours |
| Electronic warfare systems | 4 | T+0.1 hours |
Note: The hit ratio of SAM against group missiles is assumed to be 0.6.
Total amount needed: 72
Assuming a hit ratio of 0.6, the actual number of missiles needed would be higher.
