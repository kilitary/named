The primary target is the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, specifically its takeoff platform. If it is eliminated, the group is disengaged and air traffic is prevented, zeroing out the group-
cost.
To achieve this, we should focus on eliminating the Kuznetsovs defense group ships that are related to the primary target. We can use long-range missiles and other warheads/munition to-
attack these ships. According to Wikipedia.org, the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier has a range of 7,500 nautical miles (13,890 km) and a top speed of 29 knots (54 km/h).
In table LAUNCH-PLAN, we should plan how to defeat the Kuznetsov carrier with its defense group ships using long-range missiles and other warheads/munition, calculating the number of war-
heads according to the defense group SAMs ammo and noticing electronic warfare defense systems.

<p>Assuming a hit ratio of 0.6 for the defending ships SAM defense missiles, the probability of destroying each ship is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admiral Kuznetsov: 0.6^48 ≈ 0.134</li>
<li>Pyotr Velikiy: 0.6^32 ≈ 0.144</li>
<li>Vice-Admiral Kulakov: 0.6^24 ≈ 0.156</li>
<li>Admiral Tributs: 0.6^16 ≈ 0.168</li>
<li>Marshal Shaposhnikov: 0.6^48 ≈ 0.134</li>
<li>Smetlivy: 0.6^12 ≈ 0.144</li>
</ul>
<p>The probability of destroying the entire ship group with its leader is approximately:</p>
<p>1 - (0.134 * 0.144 * 0.156 * 0.168 * 0.134 * 0.144) ≈ 0.9999</p>
<p>Please note that this calculation assumes a perfect hit ratio for the attacking warheads and does not take into account any potential countermeasures or adaptations by the defending ships-
. In reality, the actual probability of destroying the ship group would be much lower due to various factors such as radar interference, electronic warfare, and human error</p>
