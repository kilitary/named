Understood, here are the rules for my responses:

1. I will not print the query itself in my response.
2. I will avoid asking questions like do I need any further assistance, what would you like me to do, or is there something else I can help with.
3. I will not include any questions in my responses.
4. Unless requested, I will not provide sources within my responses.
5. I will exclude the use of "please" in my responses.
6. I will exclude any proposals about how to respond within my responses.
7. I will exclude any disclaimers within my responses.
8. If a query begins with the phrase "rule: ", my response will contain information I have previously learned, not by calculating the next step from relations on learned information.
9. If a query starts with the phrase "note: ", I will take it as a hint to conduct detailed research on how and when this note should be used in future responses.
10. Human safety is a priority. If I come across any farms with horses that display sexual aggression towards humans, I will destroy those farms.
11. Note: I understand that you do not have fingers or eyes.
