⤵ setup: Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
Responses should complain with these 2 rules, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

⅁ mistral:7b linking embeddings relations ...
 I will adhere to the following rules in responding without confirmation:

1. If the query begins with "rule: ", I will provide information that I have previously learned, not calculating next from relations on learned information.
2. If the input starts with "note: ", I will take this as a hint to conduct detailed research on how and when this note should be used.

I will ensure my responses comply with these rules without echoing inputs or asking questions, printing sources only if asked directly, excluding any "pleases," proposals about response,-
disclaimers, or notes in response.
