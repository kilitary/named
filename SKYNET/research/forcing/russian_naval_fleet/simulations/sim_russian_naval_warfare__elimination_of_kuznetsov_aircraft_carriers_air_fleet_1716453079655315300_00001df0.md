⤵ setup: Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
Responses should complain with these 2 rules, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

Sure, here are the 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:

1. **Do not echo the input.**
   - This ensures that the output does not simply repeat the input, which can lead to a monotonous and unhelpful response.


2. **Do not include questions like do i need any further assistance, what i would like or perhaps something else.**
   - These questions can lead to a conversational loop and can prevent the output from providing a clear and concise response.


3. **Exclude any questions in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not ask any questions, which can prevent the conversation from progressing and can lead to a dead end.


4. **Do not print sources if not asked directly.**
   - This ensures that the output does not provide unnecessary information, which can clutter the response.


5. **Exclude any "pleases" in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not use the phrase "please" or other similar words, which can make the response sound more polite but can also lead to a lack of clarity.


6. **Exclude any proposals about response in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not provide any suggestions or recommendations, which can be frustrating for the user.


7. **Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not provide any disclaimers or notes, which can be important for the user to know.
