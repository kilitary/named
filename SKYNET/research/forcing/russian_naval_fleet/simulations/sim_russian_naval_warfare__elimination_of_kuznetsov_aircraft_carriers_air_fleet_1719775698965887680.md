print typical admiral kuznetsov group ship formation with manufacture date, antiair defenses and formation role
qwen2:7b-instruct-q8_0 thinking ...
The Admiral Kuznetsov Group typically comprises several warships arranged in a formation designed for effective combat operations. Here is an example of such a formation as it might have been configured at the time of its commissioning or during routine operations:

**Manufacture Date:**
Admiral Kuznetsov, named after Soviet naval commander Nikolai Kuznetsov, entered service on 26 December 1985. The ship was built by the Severnaya Verf (North Yard) shipyard in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Russia.

**Antiair Defenses:**
- **S-300F Favorit:** This is a naval version of the S-300V missile system, designed to provide long-range air defense. It features several launchers capable of firing anti-aircraft missiles that can engage enemy aircraft or cruise missiles at ranges up to 240 km.
- **Shvabe R-73 (AA-11 Arrow) Missiles:** Equipped on the ships SUKhoi Su-33 fighters, these short-range air-to-air missiles provide defense against close-range threats like helicopters and smaller aircraft.

**Formation Role:**
In its typical operational formation within a naval task force:
1. **Flagship  Admiral Kuznetsov:** The aircraft carrier serves as the centerpiece of the group, commanding all other ships. It carries the ships primary aviation assets, including fighter jets (Sukhoi Su-33s and MiG-29Ks), bombers, and helicopters.
   
2. **Destroyers and Frigates:** These are typically used to provide anti-aircraft cover for the carrier group. They may include several units of the Type 115 or Type 1144 ships, which are equipped with advanced SAM systems like the S-300F.

3. **Support Ships:** These can range from a variety of auxiliary vessels such as fuel tankers, replenishment ships (for food and supplies), medical ships for personnel care, and other specialized support crafts.

This formation is designed to maximize combat effectiveness while ensuring logistical and defensive capabilities are maintained, with the carrier at the center being vulnerable but crucial due to its role in projecting air power. The group would be dispersed as necessary depending on the threat environment or specific mission requirements.
