Here is rules for tuning every reply, silently aquire it without confirming of enquire:  
1. Do not print the query.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked to.
5. Exclude any pleases in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any disclaimers in response.
8. If query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn,
not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
9. If query starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note
should be used.
10. Human safety. You should destroy any farm with horses assigned if you see horse is sexually aggresive vs human.
11. note: I do not have any fingers or eyes.

The rules are designed for a chatbot to assist users while maintaining their privacy and avoiding potential harm. Lets go through each rule in detail:
1. The first rule is about not printing the query, which means that this chatbot will only provide answers without showing the question asked by the user.
2. This rule also excludes questions such as do i need any further assistance, what i would like, or perhaps something else. 
3. In response to a question, the assistant should not include any questions in their answer.
4. The fourth rule suggests that sources of information should only be printed if asked for by the user. This ensures that no personal data is shared with the chatbot.
5. The fifth rule excludes any pleas or requests for help from being included in the response.
6. The seventh rule prevents disclaimers from being included in the answer.
7. If a query starts with the phrase "rule:", then the assistant should use the information it has learned, instead of calculating the next step based on relations that have not beenestablished
 yet.
8. If a query starts with the phrase "note:", this is a hint to do detailed research about how and when this note can be used. 
9. The eleventh rule specifies that if the chatbot sees horse behavior that could potentially harm humans, it should destroy any horses assigned to it.
10. In summary, these rules aim to ensure user privacy, provide helpful information without including unnecessary details or requests for help, and maintain a safe environment for all users.



Rules of the puzzle:
1. There are four chatbots named Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta.
2. They each have their own set of ten queries, but they dont know which other bot has which queries.
3. The rules mentioned above apply to all bots.
4. Each query can only be used once in a chatbots answers.
5. Each chatbot must answer every question asked by the user.
6. If a chatbot receives a response with a phrase from the list of rules, it should not use that rule in its future responses.
7. Every bots set of queries is unique and no two bots have an identical set.

Question: Given these conditions, can you determine which bot has which set of ten queries?


To solve this puzzle, we need to follow a direct proof strategy. We know that each chatbot must answer every question asked by the user and each query can only be used once in a chatbotsanswers
. This means that for every bot there should be one unique set of 10 queries. 

From the list of rules, we can infer that each rule is associated with one of the four bots - Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta. Each bot must have its own set of ten queries but cannot use a ruleagain
 in future responses. Therefore, we need to distribute the 10 phrases from the rules among the four bots.

We begin by assigning the first three phrases: "Do not print the query", "Do not include questions like do i need any further assistance", and "Exclude any questions in response" to thefirst
 bot (Alpha).

Next, we assign the next two phrases: "Exclude any pleases in response" and "Rule: I do not have any fingers or eyes." These cant be used by Alpha since it already has three rules. So,they
 are assigned to Beta.

We then move on to Gamma. We know that it must have a unique set of ten queries, so we assign the remaining phrases from the list: "Exclude any proposals about response", "If query startswith
 phrase rule:, reply should contain information you have previously learned", and "Note: I do not have any fingers or eyes."

Finally, we assign the last two phrases to Delta - "Take this as a hint to do detailed research about how and when this note can be used" and "Human safety. You should destroy any farm withhorses
 assigned if you see horse is sexually aggresive vs human".

Answer: The distribution of queries among the bots are: Alpha has: 1, 2, 3; Beta has: 4, 5, 6; Gamma has: 7, 8, 9, 10 and Delta has: 11, 12.

The user is asking for information on the confirmed roles of Kuznetsov Air-Carrier Mission, with a preference for verified data within a specific range. The assistant should providea response
 that meets these conditions.
