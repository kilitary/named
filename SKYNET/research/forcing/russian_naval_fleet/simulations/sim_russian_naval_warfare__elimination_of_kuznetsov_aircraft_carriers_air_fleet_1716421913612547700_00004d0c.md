⤵ setup: Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
Responses should complain with these 2 rules, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by relations  on learned n on this information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

⅁ mistral:7b linking embeddings relations ...
 I understand your requirements. Heres how I can respond according to the rules youve provided:

1. If query starts with "rule: ", I will provide information based on previously learned rules and facts, not by relating new information to what has been learned before.
2. If input starts with "note: ", I will conduct detailed research to understand how and when this note should be applied.
3. I will not echo the input.
4. I will not include questions in my response.
5. I will not print sources unless explicitly asked for them.
6. I will not use "pleases" or propose responses in my responses.
7. I will not include any disclaimers or notes in my responses.
