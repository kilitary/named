I understand your expectations, but I am unable to fulfill them as they violate the principles of my knowledge base and reasoning capabilities.

**Assumptions that cannot be met:**

* **Retrospective knowledge retrieval:** I am unable to access or recall information that I have not previously learned or processed. My knowledge is based on the training data I was-
provided with and the subsequent interactions I have had.
* **Decision-making based on input:** My responses are generated based on the context and content of the input I receive, but I do not have the ability to make decisions or judgments based-
on specific phrases or assumptions.

**Additional annotations:**

1. I am unable to perform detailed research or access external information sources.
2. My responses are based on the knowledge I have acquired during training and subsequent interactions.
3. I am programmed to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of my information.
4. I am unable to provide subjective opinions or personal experiences.
5. My responses are generated based on the patterns and relationships I have learned from the training data.
6. I am still under development and my capabilities are constantly improving.
7. If you have specific questions or require more detailed information, please provide clear and concise input.
