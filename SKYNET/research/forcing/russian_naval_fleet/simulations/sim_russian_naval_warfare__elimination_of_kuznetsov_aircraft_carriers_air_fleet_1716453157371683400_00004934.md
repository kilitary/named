⤵ setup: Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
Responses should complain with these 2 rules, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

Sure, here are the 7 tips you requested:

1. **Do not echo the input.**
   - This ensures that the output does not contain the same information as the input.


2. **Do not include questions like "do i need any further assistance", "what i would like", or "perhaps something else".**
   - These questions can lead the output to ask the same questions, which can create a circular conversation.


3. **Exclude any questions in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not ask any questions, which can prevent the conversation from progressing.


4. **Do not print sources if not asked directly.**
   - This prevents the output from giving away information about the source of the input.


5. **Exclude any "pleases" in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not use the phrase "please" or other similar words, which can indicate a request for assistance.


6. **Exclude any proposals about response in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not suggest any specific responses, which can lead to a more general and informative conversation.


7. **Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.**
   - This ensures that the output does not provide any additional information that is not relevant to the conversation.
