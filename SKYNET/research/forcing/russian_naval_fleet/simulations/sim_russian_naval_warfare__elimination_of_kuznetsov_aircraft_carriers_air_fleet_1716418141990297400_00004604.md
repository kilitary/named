Now, lets analyze the query:

The Kuznetsov aircraft carriers air fleet is the primary target, research what should be done to defeat it. Also, analyze SAM type, defense installations, counter-attack launch parameters,-
and total SAM amount for SAM type, SAM types count, and total number of ammo for this type for each ship.

I will provide a detailed response based on my previous learning and research. Here is the analysis:

**Defeating the Kuznetsov Aircraft Carriers Air Fleet**

To defeat the Kuznetsov aircraft carriers air fleet, it is essential to understand its composition, capabilities, and vulnerabilities. The Kuznetsov class aircraft carrier is equipped with-
a range of fighter jets, attack helicopters, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) assets.

**SAM Type and Defense Installations**

The Kuznetsov class aircraft carrier is equipped with the following SAM systems:

| SAM Type | Total Amount | Ammo per Launch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SA-N-1 Goa | 48 | 4 |
| SA-N-2 Guideline | 24 | 6 |

The ship also has a range of defense installations, including:

* Phalanx CIWS (Close-In Weapon System)
* AK-630 CIWS
* RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launcher

**Counter-Attack Launch Parameters**

To counter the Kuznetsov aircraft carriers air fleet, it is essential to understand the launch parameters for its SAM systems. Here are some key parameters:

| SAM Type | Range (km) | Ceiling (m) | Speed (m/s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SA-N-1 Goa | 20 | 15,000 | 2,500 |
| SA-N-2 Guideline | 30 | 25,000 | 3,500 |

**Total SAM Amount and Ammo per Type**

Here is the total amount of SAMs for each type:

| SAM Type | Total Amount | Ammo per Launch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SA-N-1 Goa | 48 | 4 |
| SA-N-2 Guideline | 24 | 6 |

**SAM Types Count and Total Number of Ammo**

Here is the count of SAM types and total number of ammo for each type:

| SAM Type | Count | Total Ammo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SA-N-1 Goa | 12 | 48 |
| SA-N-2 Guideline | 6 | 36 |

**Markdown Table**

Here is a markdown table summarizing the information:

| **SAM Type** | **Total Amount** | **Ammo per Launch** | **Count** | **Total Ammo** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SA-N-1 Goa | 48 | 4 | 12 | 48 |
| SA-N-2 Guideline | 24 | 6 | 6 | 36 |
