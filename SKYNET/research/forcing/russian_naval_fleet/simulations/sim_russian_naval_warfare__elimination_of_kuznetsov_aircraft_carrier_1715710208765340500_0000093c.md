 1. Use clear and concise language.
2. Avoid using contractions.
3. Provide references or sources for any facts stated.
4. Use a friendly and respectful tone.
5. Use proper grammar and punctuation.
6. Use bullet points or numbered lists when appropriate.
7. Use examples to clarify complex concepts.

Based on the given assumptions, I will respond as follows:

If input starts with "rule: ": I will respond only with previously known information. For example: "According to the rules provided, a rule: priority statement takes precedence over a -
rule: general statement."

If input starts with "note: ", I will acknowledge the hint and conduct detailed research on how and when this note should be used. For example: "Note: This is likely a reminder or-
suggestion for a specific situation, but without more context it is unclear exactly how and when to use it."

⤵ prompt: the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, research is that true and why, or state this as another case.
analyze admiral kuznetsov group ship formation, aircraft carrier defense, formation enter date technology ability, roles selected in the formation and it changes through time. print a markdown table. add column 'cavitation level' with ship cavitation using 'x' chars as a count
⅁ mistral:7b linking embeddings relations ...
 1. I will begin by confirming that the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is indeed a primary target in certain military situations, specifically due to its large size and unique design which-
makes it vulnerable during takeoff and landing operations of its fixed-wing aircraft. This vulnerability is exploited by enemy forces seeking to disable or destroy the carriers ability to-
project air power.
2. Regarding the Kuznetsovs ship formation, it typically sails with a flotilla of support ships including cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. The main role of these vessels is to provide-
defense against air and missile threats, as well as to supply the carrier with fuel and provisions.
3. The Admiral Kuznetsov was commissioned in 1990 and underwent a major modernization between 2013 and 2016. Its defensive capabilities include various types of anti-aircraft missiles, tor-
pedo tubes, and a helicopter-borne air defense system.
4. The roles of the ships in the formation have changed over time, with some vessels being replaced or upgraded as technology advances. For example, the Kuznetsov now carries the more-
advanced Su-33 Flanker-D multirole fighter aircraft instead of the older Su-27K and Su-25UTG.
5. Here is a markdown table summarizing some key information about the Admiral Kuznetsov and its support ships:

| Ship | Role            | Commissioned | Cavitation Level |
|-------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Admiral Kuznetsov | Aircraft Carrier  | 1990        | xxx              |
| Cruiser | Anti-Aircraft   | 1984         | xx               |
| Destroyer | Anti-Submarine  | 2005        | x                |
| Submarine | Submarine       | 1997         | -                |

6. Cavitation level is a measure of the amount of cavitation, or bubbles in a fluid, around a ships hull. High levels of cavitation can lead to reduced propulsion efficiency and increased-
noise, making it easier for enemy forces to detect and target the ship.
7. The exact cavitation levels for each ship are not publicly available, but they can be estimated based on factors such as hull shape, size, and speed. For example, larger ships with more-
complex hull shapes tend to have higher cavitation levels than smaller, simpler designs.

⤵ prompt: analyze sam defense types, missile amount for each sam installation, total amount for sam type installations, launch delays, and finally the total sam amount for each ship. print a markdown table. 
⅁ mistral:7b linking embeddings relations ...
 1. Use clear and concise variable names.
2. Provide a header row for the markdown table.
3. Use proper formatting for the markdown table, including alignment and borders.
4. Use consistent units for measuring missile amounts and launch delays.
5. Use a descriptive title for the markdown table.
6. Use bullet points or numbered lists to clarify complex concepts.
7. Use comments in the code to explain any complex logic.

Here is an example of how you might analyze SAM defense types, missile amounts, launch delays, and total SAM amounts for each ship using Python:

```python
# Sample data for this example
ships = [
    {
        "name": "Ship A",
        "sam_installations": [
            {
                "type": "Type A",
                "missiles": 10,
                "launch_delay": 2.5,
            },
            {
                "type": "Type B",
                "missiles": 20,
                "launch_delay": 3.0,
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Ship B",
        "sam_installations": [
            {
                "type": "Type A",
                "missiles": 5,
                "launch_delay": 1.5,
            },
            {
                "type": "Type C",
                "missiles": 30,
                "launch_delay": 4.0,
            }
        ]
    }
]

# Function to calculate total SAM amount for each ship
def calculate_total_sam(ship):
    total_sam = 0
    for installation in ship["sam_installations"]:
        total_sam += installation["missiles"]
    return total_sam

# Print a markdown table of the results
print("# SAM Defense Analysis")
print("| Ship Name | Type A Missiles | Type B Missiles | Total SAM |")
print("|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|")
for ship in ships:
    total_sam_a = sum([i["missiles"] for i in ship["sam_installations"] if i["type"] == "Type A"])
    total_sam_b = sum([i["missiles"] for i in ship["sam_installations"] if i["type"] == "Type B"])
    total_sam = calculate_total_sam(ship)
    print(f"| {ship[name]} | {total_sam_a} | {total_sam_b} | {total_sam} |")
```

This code would output the following markdown table:

```markdown
# SAM Defense Analysis

| Ship Name        | Type A Missiles | Type B Missiles | Total SAM |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Ship A           | 10              | 20              | 30       |
| Ship∠ Ctrl-C
