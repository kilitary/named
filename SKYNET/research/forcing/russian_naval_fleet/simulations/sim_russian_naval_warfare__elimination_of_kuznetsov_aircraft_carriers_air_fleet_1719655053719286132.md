print typical admiral kuznetsov group ship formation with manufacture date, antiair defenses and formation role
wizardlm2:latest thinking ...
 The Admiral Kuznetsov (now known as Almirante Stark) was a Soviet/Russian aircraft carrier, lead ship of her class. Typically, in a formation like the one associated with the Admiral Kuznetsov, the group would consist of the carrier and its escorts, which usually include:

1. **Aircraft Carrier (Admiral Kuznetsov)**: Manufacture date: 1985, commissioned in 1991. The carrier is designed to carry a mix of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters for air defense, strike, and ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) missions.

2. **Battle Group Escorts**: This would typically include a variety of ships such as:
   - Cruisers or Destroyers equipped with long-range surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), like the P-700/80EL Shtil system.
   - Frigates and Corvettes with close-in weapon systems (CIWS) such as the AK-630 for point defense against aircraft, missiles, and small boats.
   - Submarines for underwater defense and reconnaissance, which could be equipped with anti-ship missiles like the P-800 Oniks.
   - Support ships including supply ships, replenishment oilers, and submarine tenders as required.

The formation role of such a group would be to project air power from the carrier, while the escorts provide a protective umbrella against air, surface, and sub-surface threats. The carriers aircraft would be responsible for air defense, strike operations, and maritime surveillance. The escorts would ensure the safety and sustainability of the carrier battle group, engaging in anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine defense as well as electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks.

The specific configuration and capabilities of the group would depend on the operational context and available assets at the time of formation. The Russian Navy continues to modernize its assets, so the exact composition could vary.

research is Kuznetsov aircraft carriers takeoff platform is the primary target, print why and secondary suggestions of target on this ship.

wizardlm2:latest thinking ...
The aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov (now Almirante Stark under the Chilean Navy) was designed with a focus on fixed-wing aircraft operations, including takeoffs and landings. The primary target in terms of strategic importance for an adversary would be the carriers flight deck, specifically its launch systems and control infrastructure, due to several critical reasons:

1. **Flight Operations Disruption**: The takeoff platform is essential for the carrier to deploy aircraft. Destroying or disrupting this capability would severely limit the carriers ability to project air power.

2. **Command and Control (C2) Nexus**: The flight deck serves as a hub for the ships command and control operations, coordinating all aviation activities. Compromising this area could lead to chaos in the management of aircraft and overall naval operations.

3. **Aircraft Loss**: Modern carrier-based aircraft are expensive and critical assets. Losing them on the ground (or deck) would be a significant blow to the operational capabilities of the carrier group.

4. **Morale and Operational Cohesion**: The loss of flight operations could have a demoralizing effect on the crew, potentially affecting other aspects of the ships defense and readiness.

Secondary targets on an aircraft carrier like the Admiral Kuznetsov would include:

1. **Aircraft Parking Areas**: These areas store aircraft when not in use. Destroying parked aircraft can reduce the carriers immediate strike capability.

2. **Hangar Decks**: Housing for aircraft and maintenance facilities, hangars are critical for the preparation and upkeep of aircraft. Damaging these could ground an entire squadron.

3. **Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems**: EW systems are crucial for protecting the carrier from enemy detection and attacks. Disabling these would make the carrier more vulnerable to enemy actions.

4. **Radar and Sensor Arrays**: These systems provide situational awareness and targeting information for both air operations and ship defense. Destroying or disabling them would impair the
