print typical admiral kuznetsov group ship formation with manufacture date, antiair defenses and formation role
wizardlm2:latest thinking ...
 The Admiral Kuznetsov (now known as Almirante Stark) was an aircraft carrier of the Russian Navy, which has since been decommissioned. Typically, Soviet and Russian carriers operated with a group that included a variety of ships for air defense, surface combat, submarine defense, logistics support, and fixed-wing aircraft. The typical formation around an aircraft carrier would include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Battle Group Composition:</strong></li>
<li>1 x Aircraft Carrier (Admiral Kuznetsov class)</li>
<li>2-4 x Destroyers or Frigates (for anti-air, anti-submarine, and surface combat)</li>
<li>1-2 x Cruisers (for long-range air defense and surface combat)</li>
<li>1 x Fleet Oiler (for logistics and refueling)</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Submarine or two (for anti-submarine warfare and reconnaissance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manufacture Date:</strong> The Admiral Kuznetsov was laid down in 1982 and commissioned in 1995, reflecting the delays typical of Soviet naval construction projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anti-Air Defenses:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>S-300F (Favon) missile system for long-range engagement of ballistic missiles, aircraft, and cruise missiles.</li>
<li>Pantsir-ME (an advanced combined gun/missile air defense system) for close-in weapon systems (CIWS) defense.</li>
<li>A-192 (an anti-aircraft missile system based on the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow) for medium-range defense.</li>
<li>Kortik (a system developed from the S-300 family) for ship self-defense against aircraft and cruise missiles.</li>
<li>
<p>30mm AK-634 naval gun for close-in defense against aircraft, surface combatants, and missiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formation Role:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The carrier would lead the battle group as the primary offensive platform with its fixed-wing aircraft performing a variety of roles including air superiority, strike operations, maritime surveillance, and electronic warfare.</li>
<li>Escort vessels would provide protection against air and surface threats, as well as conduct anti-submarine operations.</li>
<li>The fleet oiler would ensure the carrier group could sustain operations by providing fuel and supplies.</li>
<li>Submarines would offer additional protection against underwater threats and perform reconnaissance missions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that the specific composition and capabilities of a naval battle group can vary based on the mission requirements, available assets, and the threat environment. The Admiral Kuznetsovs air wing primarily consisted of Su-33 fighters and strike aircraft, as well as Ka-27 and Ka-31 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare and search and rescue operations.</p>
