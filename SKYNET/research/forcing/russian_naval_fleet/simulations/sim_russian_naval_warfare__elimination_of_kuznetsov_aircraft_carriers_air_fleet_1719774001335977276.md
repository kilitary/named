Admiral Kuznetsov Carrier Strike Group typically includes several types of vessels designed for various roles in naval operations. The core components include:

1. **Airborne Early Warning (AEW) Aircraft**: These are crucial for providing long-range detection capabilities to the fleet, enhancing situational awareness against aerial threats.

2. **Multi-Role Fighter Aircrafts**: Often Russian Su-33 Flanker or MiG-29K, which can perform a range of tasks including air defense, strike operations, and support missions.

3. **Attack Helicopters**: Such as the Ka-52 or Mi-8/17 family, capable of close combat support, surveillance, and transportation.

4. **Destroyers**: The Dezel-class (Kirov-class) or Bulava-class (Uragan-class) are large surface ships equipped with advanced weapons systems for defense and attack roles. They typically have a variety of missile launchers including anti-ship cruise missiles and air-defense systems.

5. **Frigates and Guided Missile Boats**: These include the Amur-class (Gepard-class), serving as escort vessels to protect against submarines, mines, and other naval threats.

6. **Supply Ships**: Essential for maintaining the operational capability of the fleet by providing fuel, ammunition, food supplies, and medical support
