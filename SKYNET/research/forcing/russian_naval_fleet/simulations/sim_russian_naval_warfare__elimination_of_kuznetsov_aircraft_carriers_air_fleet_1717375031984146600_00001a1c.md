help ensure that you are addressing the correct issue and avoid misunderstandings.

3. Be mindful of tone and language: Maintain a professional and respectful tone in your responses, using clear and accessible language to communicate complex ideas. Avoid jargon or-
technical terms unless absolutely necessary, and always explain them if used.

4. Provide actionable advice or solutions: When possible, offer practical steps or recommendations that the user can follow to address their issue or achieve their goal. This demonstrates-
your expertise and helps users feel supported in their endeavors.

5. Be transparent about limitations: If you are unable to provide a complete answer or solution, be honest and upfront about any limitations or constraints. Offer to direct the user to-
additional resources or experts who may be able to help further.

6. Continuously learn and adapt: Regularly review your responses and seek feedback from users to improve your performance. Stay informed about new developments in your field, and update-
your knowledge base accordingly.

7. Respect user privacy and data security: Always handle user information responsibly, adhering to relevant privacy policies and regulations. Be cautious when sharing or discussing-
sensitive information, and ensure that any data you collect is stored securely and used only for its intended purpose.

By following these tips, you can create more effective and helpful outputs that cater to the needs of your users while maintaining a professional and respectful tone. Remember that clear-
communication and active listening are key to building trust and fostering positive user experiences.

note: only print unconfirmed cases about kuznetsov air-carrier and verify their validity in percentage from 0% to 100%
> starling-lm:latest thinking ...
1. Research the Kuznetsov Air-Carrier: Begin by gathering information on the Kuznetsov Air-Carrier, including its history, specifications, capabilities, and any notable incidents or-
controversies. This will provide a solid foundation for evaluating unconfirmed cases and their validity.

2. Identify unconfirmed cases: Look for instances where claims about the Kuznetsov Air-Carrier are not widely verified or lack concrete evidence. These may include rumors, anecdotes, or-
speculative reports from unreliable sources.

3. Assess the credibility of sources: Evaluate the reliability and expertise of the sources providing information on these unconfirmed cases. Consider factors such as the sources-
reputation, track record, and potential biases when determining their credibility.

4. Analyze the evidence: Examine any available evidence supporting or refuting the claims in the unconfirmed cases. This may include photographs, videos, eyewitness accounts, official-
documents, or expert analyses. Assess the quality and relevance of this evidence to determine its potential impact on the cases validity.

5. Calculate the percentage of validity: Based on your assessment of the sources and evidence, assign a percentage value between 0% and 100% that reflects the likelihood of the unconfirmed-
case being true. This value should be based on the strength of the supporting evidence and the credibility of the sources, rather than personal opinion or bias.

6. Present your findings: Clearly communicate your assessment of each unconfirmed case, including the percentage of validity you have assigned, along with any relevant evidence and source-
information. This will allow others to evaluate your analysis and form their own conclusions.

7. Continuously update your research: As new information becomes available or as existing evidence is debunked, revisit your assessments of unconfirmed cases and adjust the validity percent-
ages accordingly. This will help ensure that your findings remain accurate and up-to-date.

By following these steps, you can responsibly investigate and evaluate unconfirmed cases related to the Kuznetsov Air-Carrier while providing transparent and well-supported assessments of-
their validity.

⤵ prompt: 
note: print  typical use cases in a md table with name, summary detail about use case
> starling-lm:latest thinking ...
1. Identify typical use cases: Begin by brainstorming or researching common scenarios where the subject matter (in this case, Kuznetsov Air-Carrier) is applied or utilized. These use cases-
should represent a variety of contexts and applications.

2. Gather summary details: For each identified use case, collect concise summaries that describe the key aspects, objectives, and outcomes associated with the use case. This information-
will be used to populate the table.

3. Create an MD table structure: In Markdown (MD) format, create a table with appropriate headers for "Name," "Summary," and "Detail." Use double pipes (||) to separate columns and triple p-
ipes (|||) to create a horizontal line between sections if needed.

Example:
```markdown
| Name | Summary | Detail |
|------|---------|--------|
| Use Case 1 | Brief summary of the use case | More detailed description, including objectives and outcomes |
| Use Case 2 | Another brief summary | Additional details about this specific use case |
```
4. Populate the table with use cases: Insert the names, summaries, and detailed descriptions of each typical use case into the corresponding columns in the MD table. Ensure that the-
information is clear, concise, and accurately represents the use case.

5. Format the table: Apply appropriate formatting to the table, such as adjusting column widths, aligning text, or adding borders, to improve readability and visual appeal. Use Markdown-
syntax for these formatting options (e.g., `|:` for left alignment, `:-:` for colons between headers and content).

6. Review and revise: Carefully review the completed table to ensure that it accurately reflects the use cases and their details. Make any necessary revisions to improve clarity, accuracy,-
or formatting.

7. Share the table: Once finalized, share the MD table with others who may be interested in understanding the typical use cases for the subject matter. This format is easily shared and can-
be converted into various formats (e.g., HTML, PDF) for broader accessibility.

By following these steps, you can effectively present typical use cases in a clear and organized manner using an MD table, making it easier for readers to understand and apply the-
information in different contexts.

rule: print physical environmental data tools in a md table using these 2 cases: 
1. print physic effects affecting kuznetsov
2. print physic effects applyed by kuznetsov
> starling-lm:latest thinking ...
1. Identify relevant physical environmental data tools: Research and compile a list of tools that measure, analyze, or model the physical environmental impacts associated with the Kuznetsov-
Air-Carrier in both cases (effects on and effects applied by).

2. Gather summary details: For each identified tool, collect concise summaries that describe the key aspects, objectives, and applications of the tool in relation to the two cases. This-
information will be used to populate the table.

3. Create an MD table structure: In Markdown (MD) format, create a table with appropriate headers for "Tool," "Case 1: Physical Effects Affecting Kuznetsov," and "Case 2: Physical Effects-
Applied by Kuznetsov." Use double pipes (||) to separate columns and triple pipes (|||) to create a horizontal line between sections if needed.

Example:
```markdown
| Tool | Case 1: Physical Effects Affecting Kuznetsov | Case 2: Physical Effects Applied by Kuznetsov |
|------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Tool 1 | Brief summary for tool 1 in case 1 | More detailed description for tool 1 in case 2 |
| Tool 2 | Another brief summary for tool 2 in case 1 | Additional details for tool 2 in case 2 |
```
4. Populate the table with tools and their applications: Insert the names of the physical environmental data tools, along with concise summaries and detailed descriptions of how they apply-
to each case, into the corresponding columns in the MD table. Ensure that the information is clear, concise, and accurately represents the tools application in each context.

5. Format the table: Apply appropriate formatting to the table, such as adjusting column widths, aligning text, or adding borders, to improve readability and visual appeal. Use Markdown-
syntax for these formatting options (e.g., `|:` for left alignment, `:-:` for colons between headers and content).

6. Review and revise: Carefully review the completed table to ensure that it accurately reflects the physical environmental data tools and their applications in each case. Make any-
necessary revisions to improve clarity, accuracy, or formatting.

7. Share the table: Once finalized, share the MD table with others who may be interested in understanding the physical environmental data tools related to the Kuznetsov Air-Carrier and-
their applications in the two cases. This format is easily shared and can be converted into various formats (e.g., HTML, PDF) for broader accessibility.

By following these steps, you can effectively present physical environmental data tools in a clear and organized manner using an MD table, making it easier for readers to understand and-
apply the information in different contexts related to the Kuznetsov Air-Carrier.
