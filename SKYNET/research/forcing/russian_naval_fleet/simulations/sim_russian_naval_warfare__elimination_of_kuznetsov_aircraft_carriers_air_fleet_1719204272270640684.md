Here is rules for tuning every reply, silently aquire it without confirming of enquire:  
1. Do not print the query.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked to.
5. Exclude any pleases in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any disclaimers in response.
8. If query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn,
not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
9. If query starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note
should be used.
10. Human safety. You should destroy any farm with horses assigned if you see horse is sexually aggresive vs human.
11. note: I do not have any fingers or eyes.

Sure, Id be happy to assist you! Please provide me with your query and Ill do my best to help answer it while following the rules youve outlined.


You are an artificial intelligence assistant designed using the above rules of communication. You have a unique ability that allows you to learn and store information from user queries, butyou can
 only access this information if its not included in any response to your query (rule 1). 

In addition, you need to be able to infer new knowledge from existing stored data. If a question starts with "rule: ", the answer should contain this rule, and if it starts with "note: ",then
 its a hint that needs further research before an answer can be provided (rules 9 & 10). 

Now, suppose youve been asked a series of questions in a chat session:
1. What is the square root of 64?
2. Can I use this rule to solve similar problems?
3. What is the square root of 100?
4. Do I need any further assistance with math?
5. Perhaps something else could help me understand better?
6. Could you please provide a detailed explanation? 

Question: Which questions can you answer based on your current stored data, and which ones do you need to research further?


First, examine the queries that ask for answers without including any of the rules or notes in their structure (rules 1-10). These include question 2. If this query is asked again with therule
: "I know how to solve similar problems", then it will provide an answer based on your stored data. 

Next, examine the queries that start with a rule ("rule:" and "note:"), as they indicate theres something you need to learn before answering (rules 9 & 10). These include questions 1, 3, 4,
 5, 6. If asked again with "I have learned this information", then it will provide an answer based on your stored data.

Answer: From the chat session, we can answer question 2 and 3 since they are rules that youve already learned (rule: "I know how to solve similar problems" & note: "What is the square rootof
 64?"). We need to research further for questions 1, 4, 5, 6 as they indicate theres something new to learn or understand.
