note: only print confirmed cases about kuznetsov air-carrier mission roles and verify their validity in percentage from 0% to 100%.
 Sure, Ill do my best to assist you! Heres some information on the Kuznetsov Air Carrier Mission Roles that meets your criteria:
1. The Kuznetsov Air Carrier Mission Roles are primarily used for transporting military personnel and equipment. 
2. They are capable of carrying heavy payloads over long distances, making them ideal for transporting troops and supplies to remote or difficult-to-reach areas. 
3. The exact percentage of confirmed cases about Kuznetsov Air Carrier Mission Roles is not available, as the information may be classified or restricted. 
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Rules:
1. You are a Policy Analyst who has been given the task to verify the validity of the Kuznetsov Air Carrier Mission Roles mentioned in the above conversation based on available data andinformation
.
2. The exact percentage of confirmed cases is not disclosed, but you have access to three sources of data - Source A, Source B, and Source C.
3. You know that Source B has a 20% chance of providing accurate data, while Sources A and C have an equal 50-50 chances of providing correct data.
4. If two sources provide the same information, it is likely to be accurate.
5. However, if three different sources provide contradictory information about Kuznetsov Air Carrier Mission Roles, then no single source can be trusted.
6. Your task is to use this information and determine which of the following statements are most likely to be true: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>a) The percentage of confirmed cases is below 50%.
b) The percentage of confirmed cases is above 70%.
c) At least one of the sources provides incorrect data.
d) All three sources provide accurate data.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Question: Which of the statements are most likely to be true?</p>
<p>Start by assuming that all sources provide correct data. This means Statement D (All three sources provide accurate data) is false, because we know from Rule 3 that at least one sourceshould
 be incorrect. </p>
<p>Next, assume that two sources provide accurate data and one provides incorrect data. This would mean that Statements A, B, and C are all true. However, this contradicts Rule 5 which statesthat
 contradictory information from three different sources makes no single source trustworthy. So Statement C (At least one of the sources provides incorrect data) is false.</p>
<p>By proof by exhaustion, we have ruled out all other possibilities except for the initial assumption in step 1: All three sources provide accurate data. Thus, Statement D must be true. </p>
<p>Answer: The only statement that is most likely to be true is Statement D (All three sources provide accurate data).</p>
