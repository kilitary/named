I will follow the rules as stated, but I would like to clarify that there is no such thing as a "confirmed case" of Kuznetsov Air Carrier Mission Roles. The Kuznetsov Air Carrier was aSoviet
/Russian aircraft carrier and it did not have any specific mission roles. It was primarily used for testing and training purposes. If you are referring to the Kuznetsovs role in the ColdWar
, I will provide information based on my knowledge of that time period.

 llama3-gradient:latest thinking ...
The Kuznetsov was not a primary target in the Cold War. The Soviet Union did not have a "Cold War" like the United States did. The term "Cold War" is an American invention to describe thepost
-World War II period of political tension between the two superpowers, but it does not accurately reflect the situation in the Soviet Union. The Kuznetsov was primarily used for testing andtraining
 purposes.
