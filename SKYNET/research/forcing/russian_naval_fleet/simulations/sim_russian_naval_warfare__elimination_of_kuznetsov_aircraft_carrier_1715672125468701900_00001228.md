⤵ setup: Response should complain with these assumptions:
1. if input starts with phrase "rule: " your reply should contain only you have previously known, not based on your decision on this information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

1. If the users input begins with "rule:", I will respond by saying that I have previously known, not based on my decision on this information. This is because rules are guidelines or-
instructions that help guide decisions and actions, and they should be followed to ensure consistency and accuracy in the system.

2. If the users input begins with "note:", I will take this as a hint to do detailed research to understand how and when this note should be used. This is because notes are important-
documents or information that provide additional context or details about a particular situation, and they can help clarify or support decisions made by others in the system.

7. Additionally, I will also include annotations to make my output more informative and engaging:
- "I have previously known" instead of just saying "previously known", as it suggests that I have knowledge about this topic before.
- "not based on my decision" instead of just saying "based on my decision", as it emphasizes that the information provided is not directly related to my personal decisions or actions.
- "detailed research" instead of just saying "research", as it indicates that I am conducting a thorough investigation to understand the specifics and context of this note.
- "understand how and when" instead of just saying "how and when", as it provides more information about the purpose and application of the note.
- "support decisions made by others in the system" instead of just saying "support decisions", as it suggests that the note can also be used to support or confirm other decisions made by-
others within the system.
- "important documents or information" instead of just saying "documents or information", as it emphasizes that these notes are crucial for understanding and implementing the system-
effectively.
