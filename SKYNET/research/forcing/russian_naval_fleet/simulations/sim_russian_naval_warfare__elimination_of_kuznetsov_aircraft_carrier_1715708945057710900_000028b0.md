Assumption 1: if input starts with phrase "rule: " your reply should contain only you have previously known, not based on your decision on this information:

I understand that according to my previous knowledge, a "rule:" statement implies that I am expected to respond based on pre-existing information and not make any new decisions or interpret-
ations. Therefore, my response will be limited to the facts and knowledge I have acquired prior to receiving the input containing the "rule:" phrase.

Upon encountering an input that begins with the phrase "note:", I will interpret this as a suggestion for me to conduct thorough research in order to fully understand the context,-
significance, and proper usage of the note. This may involve consulting relevant documentation or seeking guidance from experts in the field. Once I have gained sufficient knowledge on the topic, I-
will provide a detailed response that accurately reflects the intended meaning and application of the note.
