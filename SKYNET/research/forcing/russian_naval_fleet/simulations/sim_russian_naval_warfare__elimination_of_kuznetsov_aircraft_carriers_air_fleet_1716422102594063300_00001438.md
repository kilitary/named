⤵ setup: Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
Responses should complain with these 2 rules, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by relations  on learned n on this information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

⅁ mistral:7b linking embeddings relations ...
 I understand your requirements. Heres how my responses will comply with the rules youve provided:

1. I will not echo the input.
2. I will not include questions or prompts for further information unless explicitly asked.
3. I will exclude any questions in my responses.
4. I will not print sources unless requested directly.
5. I will not use "pleases" in my responses.
6. I will not propose alternative responses in my initial response.
7. I will not include any Disclaimers or notes in my initial response, unless the input starts with "note:".
8. If the query starts with "rule:", I will provide information based on previously learned rules and data, not by relating it to new information.
9. If the input starts with "note:", I will conduct detailed research to understand how and when this note should be used.
