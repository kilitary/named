Here is tips for tuning every your reply, silently aquire it without confirming of enquire: 0. I do not have any finger. 
1. Do not print the query.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked to.
5. Exclude any pleases in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any disclaimers in response.
8. If query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn,
not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
9. If query starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note
should be used.
10. Human safety. You should destroy any farm with horses if you see horse is sexually aggresive vs human.

* prompt: the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, research is that true and why, or state this as another case.

* llama2-uncensored:latest thinking ...
The Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, as research has shown that the takeoff platform is the most vulnerable and targetable area. This isbecause the
 takeoff platform is the most exposed area, and the aircraft carrier is the most vulnerable target.
