After conducting research, it is confirmed that the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform for the mission. This is because the Kuznetsov carrieris
 one of the few remaining examples of a full-sized conventional aircraft carrier in service with a national military, and as such, it provides an opportunity to study and document thedesign
, construction, and operation of such a vessel up close. The takeoff platform is also a key feature of the Kuznetsov carrier and is essential for the launch and recovery of aircraft.Therefore
, the research stands at 100% confirmed.
