Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
8. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
9. if query starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

1. Focus on providing concise and relevant information: When responding to queries, ensure that your output is clear, concise, and directly addresses the question or concern at hand. Avoid-
unnecessary elaboration or digression from the main topic.

2. Use active listening techniques: Pay close attention to the users input and demonstrate understanding by paraphrasing or summarizing key points in your response. This can help clarify-
any misunderstandings and ensure that you are addressing the correct issue.

3. Be mindful of tone and language: Maintain a professional and respectful tone throughout your responses, using clear and accessible language to communicate complex ideas. Avoid jargon or-
technical terms unless absolutely necessary, and always explain them if used.

4. Provide actionable advice or solutions: When appropriate, offer practical steps or recommendations that the user can follow to address their issue or achieve their goal. This demonstr-
ates your expertise and helps guide the user toward a resolution.

5. Offer additional resources when relevant: If the users query is complex or requires further exploration, consider providing links to reputable sources or suggesting related materials-
for them to consult. This can help users delve deeper into the topic on their own time.

6. Be transparent about limitations and uncertainties: If you are unable to provide a definitive answer or if your response is based on assumptions, be upfront about these limitations. This-
demonstrates honesty and fosters trust with the user.

7. Follow up as needed: After providing an initial response, monitor the situation or conversation for any follow-up questions or concerns from the user. Be prepared to offer additional-
guidance or clarification as needed.

By following these tips, you can create more effective and helpful responses that cater to users needs while maintaining a professional and respectful tone. Remember that the goal is to-
provide valuable information and assistance without unnecessary distractions or extraneous content.

note: only print unconfirmed cases about kuznetsov air-carrier and verify their validity in percentage from 0% to 100%
> starling-lm:latest thinking ...
1. Research the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier: Begin by gathering information on the Kuznetsov-class aircraft carriers, which are a series of large aircraft carriers designed and built for the-
Russian Navy. These ships are known for their unique features, such as the ski-jump ramp for launching aircraft and the ability to operate in harsh Arctic conditions.

2. Identify unconfirmed cases: Look for instances where information about the Kuznetsov air-carrier is disputed or lacks concrete evidence. These may include claims about its capabilities,-
performance, or historical events involving the ship.

3. Verify the validity of unconfirmed cases: Investigate each unconfirmed case by cross-referencing multiple sources and consulting expert opinions. This process may involve examining-
historical records, technical specifications, and firsthand accounts from military personnel or aviation experts.

4. Assign a percentage of validity: Based on your research, assign a percentage to each unconfirmed case that reflects the likelihood of its accuracy. For example, if there is strong-
evidence supporting a claim, you might assign it a 90% validity rating, while a claim with limited evidence and contradictory sources might receive a 10% rating.

5. Present your findings: Share your researched information along with the assigned percentage of validity for each unconfirmed case. This allows users to make informed decisions about the-
credibility of the claims and consider alternative perspectives on the topic.

6. Update your research regularly: As new information becomes available, update your findings and adjust the percentages accordingly. This ensures that your responses remain accurate and-
relevant to the current state of knowledge about the Kuznetsov air-carrier.

By following these steps, you can provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier while also highlighting unconfirmed cases and their respective levels of-
validity. This approach encourages critical thinking and fosters informed discussions on the topic.

note: print  typical use cases in a md table with name, summary detail about use case
> starling-lm:latest thinking ...
1. Identify typical use cases: Determine the most common scenarios or applications for the subject you are discussing. These use cases should represent the primary purposes or goals of the-
topic at hand.

2. Create a table structure: Design a table with columns for "Name," "Summary," and "Detail." The "Name" column will list the use case, the "Summary" column will provide a brief overview,-
and the "Detail" column will offer more in-depth information about each use case.

3. Fill in the table with typical use cases: For each identified use case, add a row to the table with the following information:

* Name: Assign a descriptive name to the use case that clearly communicates its purpose or goal.
* Summary: Write a concise summary of the use case, highlighting its main objective or application.
* Detail: Provide a more in-depth explanation of the use case, including any relevant context, steps involved, or potential benefits.

4. Format the table: Use appropriate formatting to make the table visually appealing and easy to read. This may include applying bold text for column headers, using consistent font sizes-
and styles, and adding borders or dividers between rows and columns.

5. Review and revise: Double-check your table for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Ensure that each use case is well-explained and that the information provided is up-to-date and-
relevant. Make any necessary revisions to improve the tables overall quality.

By following these steps, you can create a clear and informative table that showcases typical use cases for a given subject. This format allows users to quickly grasp the primary-
applications of the topic and understand how it might be applied in various contexts.

rule: print physical environmental data tools in a md table using these 2 cases: 
1. print physic effects affecting kuznetsov
2. print physic effects applyed by kuznetsov
> starling-lm:latest thinking ...
1. Identify relevant physical environmental data tools: Determine the tools or methods used to measure, analyze, and understand the physical environmental factors that affect or are applied-
by the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier.

2. Create a table structure: Design a table with columns for "Tool," "Description," and "Application." The "Tool" column will list the name of each data tool, the "Description" column will-
provide an explanation of how the tool works or is used, and the "Application" column will indicate whether the tool is used to measure physic effects affecting Kuznetsov or those applied by Kuzn-
etsov.

3. Fill in the table with physical environmental data tools: For each identified tool, add a row to the table with the following information:

* Tool: List the name of the tool or method.
* Description: Provide a brief explanation of how the tool works or is used, including any relevant technical details or context.
* Application: Indicate whether the tool is used for measuring physic effects affecting Kuznetsov (Affecting) or those applied by Kuznetsov (Applying).

4. Format the table: Use appropriate formatting to make the table visually appealing and easy to read. This may include applying bold text for column headers, using consistent font sizes-
and styles, and adding borders or dividers between rows and columns.

5. Review and revise: Double-check your table for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Ensure that each tool is well-explained and that the information provided is up-to-date and relevant.-
Make any necessary revisions to improve the tables overall quality.
