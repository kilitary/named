1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by relations  on learned n on this information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

Im sorry, but it seems like youve provided instructions rather than a specific query. If you have any questions or need information related to rules or notes, please feel free to ask!

If your question starts with "rule:", I will provide relevant information based on what I know up until my last update in 2021. For example:

Rule: In many countries, its against the law to drive without a valid drivers license.

If your query begins with "note:", please share more details so that I can assist you better by conducting thorough research on its usage and application.

⤵ prompt: the Kuznetsov aircraft carriers air fleet is the primary target, research what should be done to defeait it. also analyze sam type, defense installations, counter-attack launch params, and total sam amount for sam type, sam types count and total number of ammo for this type for each ship. print a markdown table.

Im sorry, but it seems like youre referring to fictional scenarios or specific game details that I dont have information on as of my last update in 2021. However, if this is a hypothet-
ical situation within the context of a strategy game, heres how one might structure their analysis:

```markdown
| Sam Type | Number of Ships | Total Ammo per Type | Defense Installations | Counter-Attack Launch Parameters |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Kuznetsov Carriers | X (replace with hypothetical number) | Y (replace with hypothetical amount) | Z1, Z2, ... | A1, A2, ... |
```

Please note that for a real-world application or specific game strategy, you would need to refer to the latest information available from credible sources.

⤵ prompt: analyze summary effects for each side and print a markdown score table.
⅁ phi3:latest linking embeddings relations ...
To analyze the summary effects for each side, well need specific details about the sides involved in the scenario youre referring to. Once provided, I can create a Markdown-formatted-
score table that evaluates and compares their respective impacts or outcomes based on the given criteria. Here are some additional guidelines to ensure clarity:

1. Clearly define each side being compared.
2. Specify the criteria for evaluation (e.g., economic, social, environmental).
3. Provide any relevant data or information that will be used in the analysis.
4. Ensure consistency and fairness in scoring across all sides.
5. Include a brief explanation of how scores were assigned to each criterion.
6. Use headers for different sections within the table (e.g., Criteria, Side A Score, Side B Score).
7. Format the table with proper Markdown syntax for readability and professional presentation.

Once you provide the necessary details, Ill be able to generate a comprehensive score table for your analysis.

⤵ prompt: analyze summary effects on each side and print it in a table.
⅁ phi3:latest linking embeddings relations ...
To analyze the summary effects on each side, well need specific details about the sides involved and the context of the situation or event being summarized. Once provided with this-
information, I can help you create a table that outlines the potential impacts on both sides. Here is an example structure for such a table:

| Side A                   | Effects on Side A                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Side B                   | Effects on Side B                           |

Please provide more details about the situation, including what "Side A" and "Side B" represent, so I can assist you further.

⤵ prompt: print a html page with all previous answers and information, with 'HR' delimetering INFO sections.
⅁ phi3:latest linking embeddings relations ...
To create an HTML page that displays previously provided answers and information separated by HR (horizontal rule) tags, you can use the following template as a starting point. Please note-
that I will not be able to include actual previous answers since they were not provided in this context. However, Ill demonstrate how it would look with placeholder text:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Previous Answers and Information</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Summary of Previous Responses</h1>
    
    <hr>
    
    <section id="rule_info">
        <h2>Rule-Based Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Info:</strong> In many countries, its against the law to drive without a valid drivers license.</p>
    </section>
    
    <hr>
    
    <section id="note_info">
        <h2>Note-Based Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Info:</strong> Please provide more details for a comprehensive note analysis.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Additional sections can be added here following the same structure -->
    
</body>
</html>
```

To include actual previous answers, you would replace the placeholder text within each `<p>` tag with the relevant content. Additionally, if there are specific styles or layouts youd like-
to apply, consider adding CSS rules in a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML document.
