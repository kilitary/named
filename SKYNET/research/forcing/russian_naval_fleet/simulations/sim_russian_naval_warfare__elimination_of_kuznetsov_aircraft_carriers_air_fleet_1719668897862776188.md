print typical admiral kuznetsov group ship formation with manufacture date, antiair defenses and formation role
qwen2:7b-instruct-q8_0 thinking ...
The Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is part of the Russian Navys Northern Fleet. Its typical operational grouping includes several types of ships for various roles:

1. **Air Defense**: The air defense ships are crucial components in protecting the Kuznetsov group from enemy aircraft, missiles, and other threats. Typically, this would include destroyers like the Admiral Grigorovich class (e.g., Vice Admiral Kulakov) or frigates such as the Project 1154M (Uran) class.

   - **Manufacture Date**: The Admiral Grigorovich class was designed in the late 20th century and entered service from the early 2000s. The Uran-class frigate is a more recent design, starting production around the same time.
   
   - **Antiair Defenses**: These ships are equipped with advanced air defense systems such as the S-300V4 (or older versions like S-300PMU2) for long-range interception and the Pantsir-S1 system for medium to short-range protection. They also carry surface-to-air missiles and have a complement of naval guns.

2. **Escort**: Escort ships provide additional support, ensuring the safety of the carrier group against submarines and other underwater threats. The Project 1156M (Varyag) class is often used in this role.

   - **Manufacture Date**: This class was designed in the late 1980s to early 1990s and entered service from the mid-1990s onwards.
   
   - **Submarine Defense Systems**: These ships are equipped with advanced sonar systems, torpedoes, and anti-submarine weapons like depth charges or ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) helicopters.

3. **Replenishment Ships**: These vessels provide fuel, ammunition, provisions, and maintenance support for the carrier group. Examples include large oilers such as the Admiral Makarov-class (e.g., Admiral Essen).

   - **Manufacture Date**: The design of these ships often dates back several decades but they are continually updated to maintain operational capability.

4. **Command Ship**: A command ship is essential for coordinating operations within the carrier group and maintaining communications with other units or headquarters. Examples include the Project 1270 (Sovremenny) class, which can serve in this role due to their advanced electronics and communication capabilities.
