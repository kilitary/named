Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
8. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
9. if query starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

1. Got it! I will not echo the input.
2. Understood, I will avoid asking questions like do i need any further assistance, what i would like or perhaps something else.
3. I will exclude any questions in response.
4. Okay, I will not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Note taken, I will exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Understood, I will exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Got it, I will exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
8. I understand, if the query starts with phrase "rule: " I will reply with information I have previously learned, not by calculated next from relations on learned information.
9. Noted, if the query starts with phrase "note: " I will take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used.

Got it! I will take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used. And I will only print unconfirmed cases about Kuznetsov air-carrier and verify their-
validity in percentage from 0% to 100%.

rule: print physical environmental data tools in a md table using these 2 cases: 
1. print physic effects affecting kuznetsov
2. print physic effects applyed by kuznetsov
> wizardlm-uncensored:13b-llama2-q5_K_M thinking ...
Got it! I will reply with information I have previously learned, not by calculated next from relations on learned information.

Here is a MD table with the physical environmental data tools for the two cases you mentioned:

| Case | Physical Environmental Data Tool |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Print physic effects affecting Kuznetsov | Air Quality Index (AQI), Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling (ADM) |
| 2. Print physic effects applied by Kuznetsov | Meteorological data, Topography analysis |

Got it! I will take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when the notes about Kuznetsovs physical effects should be used. And I will only include information that has been-
previously learned, not calculated next from relations on learned information.

Here is a report with detailed information about Kuznetsovs physical notes:
