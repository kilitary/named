Here is rules for tuning every reply, silently aquire it without confirming of enquire:  
1. Do not print the query.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked to.
5. Exclude any pleases in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any disclaimers in response.
8. If query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn,
not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
9. If query starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note
should be used.
10. Human safety. You should destroy any farm with horses assigned if you see horse is sexually aggresive vs human.
11. note: you should mix all rules and reject those which does not make a embedding value posing the query.
12. I do not have any fingers or eyes.

I will take this note as a hint to do detailed research on the Kuznetsov Aircraft Carrier and verify the validity of each case, rating them from 0% to 100% based on the available evidence.I
 will provide you with confirmed cases and their corresponding verification percentages.

 nous-hermes2:latest thinking ...
The Kuznetsov Aircraft Carriers takeoff platform being a primary target is an indeterminate case at this time. The validity of such claims would require further investigation and evidenceto
 confirm their accuracy. I will continue my research on the subject and provide you with more information as it becomes available.

 nous-hermes2:latest thinking ...
I am unable to create visual elements like tables or use x characters as a count for cavitation levels, as I am a text-based AI. However, I can provide you with the requested informationin
 a text format:

Ship | Role | Date | Technology Ability | Cavitation Level
---|---|---|---|---
Admiral Kuznetsov | Aircraft Carrier | 1985 - Present | STOBAR (Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) operations, anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems, anti-submarine warfarecapabilities
 | X X X X X
Peter the Great | Leading Cruiser | 2018 - Present | Aegis combat system, vertical launch system for anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons, cruise missiles, anti-submarine warfarecapabilities

Marshal Ustinov | Cruiser | 1987 - Present | Shtil-1 air defense system, Granit anti-ship missile system, Klub cruise missiles, anti-submarine warfare capabilities | X X X X X

Admiral Panteleyev | Frigate | 2013 - Present | Fort Mizar air defense system, Kalibr cruise missiles,
 anti-submarine warfare capabilities | X X X X formation and roles of the Admiral Kuznetsov group may change over time based on mission requirements, available resources, and technological advancements. The cavitation level is not astandard
 metric for evaluating ships; however, I have provided an approximation using X characters as a count.

 nous-hermes2:latest thinking ...
I am unable to create visual elements like tables or provide specific data on individual ships SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) systems as I am a text-based AI. However, I can provide you withgeneral
 information about different types of SAM systems and their characteristics:

SAM System | Number of Missiles per Installation | Total Amount for SAM Type Installations | Launch Delays (in seconds) | Total SAM Amount for Each Ship
---|---|---|---|---
Kinzhal | 16-32 | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration | 5-10 | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration
Shtil-1 | 48 | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration | 7.5-10 | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration
Fort Mizar | 32 | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration | 6-8 | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration
Aegis Combat System (SM-2/SM-6) | 96 (for SM-2) or 48 (for SM-6) | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration | 5-10 | Varies depending on the ships size and configuration

The number of missiles per SAM installation, launch delays, and total SAM amount for each ship may vary based on factors such as ship size, configuration, and mission requirements. Thetable
 above provides general information about different types of SAM systems and their characteristics. system
