* phi3:latest thinking ...
 Im sorry, but as an AI developed by Microsoft, I dont have the ability to access or retrieve real-time data. However, I can guide you on how you might approach this task using available-
resources and methodologies.

To analyze unconfirmed cases about Kuznetsov air carrier and verify their validity in percentage, you could follow these steps:

1. Data collection: Gather information from various sources such as news articles, social media posts, forums, or industry reports that mention the Kuznetsov air carrier. Make sure to-
identify unconfirmed cases within this data set.

2. Establish criteria: Define a clear set of criteria to determine whether an incident is confirmed or not. This could include factors such as official statements from the company, corrobor-
ating evidence, and time elapsed since the event occurred.

3. Data analysis: Analyze each unconfirmed case based on your established criteria. Assign a probability percentage that reflects how likely it is for an incident to be confirmed (e.g., 0%-
- completely unlikely; 100% - highly probable). This step may require expert judgment and subjective assessment, as youll need to evaluate the available evidence.

4. Calculate overall percentage: To calculate a general validity percentage for all unconfirmed cases, sum up the probability percentages assigned in step 3 and divide by the total number-
of unconfirmed cases. This will give you an average likelihood that these incidents are confirmed.

5. Update as new information becomes available: As more data is collected or official statements are released, update your analysis to reflect any changes in validity percentages for each-
case and recalculate the overall percentage.

Remember that this approach will provide an estimation based on the available evidence at a given time. Its essential to continuously monitor new information and adjust your assessment-
accordingly.

allowing for easy customization of printed messages. This is useful when displaying user-friendly information or creating structured reports. |
| Print to File | Writes data to a file instead of printing it on the console. | The `print()` function can be used with the `file` parameter to redirect output to a text file, enabling-
logging and saving results for later analysis. This is particularly useful in applications that require record-keeping or reporting. |
| Print Multiple Items | Prints multiple items separated by a specified delimiter. | The `print()` function can concatenate several values using the `*` operator, making it convenient to-
display lists, tuples, or other iterable objects as formatted output. This is helpful when presenting data in tabular format or displaying results from calculations. |
| Print with Separator | Prints items separated by a specified separator between them. | The `print()` function allows for customization of the separator character using the `sep` parameter-
, enabling flexible formatting options such as comma-separated values (CSV) output or tabular data representation. This is useful in generating reports and exporting data to various formats.-
|
| Print with End Characters | Specifies the string that will be printed at the end of each line. | The `print()` functions `end` parameter can be set to a custom character, such as newline-
(`\n`) or space, allowing for control over the output formatting and layout. This is beneficial when creating multi-line outputs or aligning text in specific ways. |
| Print with Flags | Controls the behavior of the print function using various flags. | The `print()` function supports several optional flags like `end`, `file`, `flush`, etc., providing-
flexibility for customizing output formatting and handling special cases, such as suppressing newline characters or flushing buffered data immediately. This is useful in scenarios where precise-
control over the printing process is required. |
| Print with File Objects | Writes to a file-like object instead of standard output. | The `print()` function can be used with any object that supports the iterator protocol, such as files-
or custom objects implementing `__iter__` and `__next__`. This allows for seamless integration with file operations and other data streams in Python applications. |

, batch processing scripts, or any scenario where real-time progress tracking is desired. |
| Print with Custom Formatting | Prints messages using custom formatting rules defined by the user. | The `print()` function can be extended through third-party libraries like `textwrap` or-
custom implementations that support advanced string manipulation and formatting techniques, allowing for precise control over output appearance and alignment. This is useful when creating complex-
reports, generating formatted text outputs, or integrating with specialized data processing pipelines. |
| Print in Command Line Tools | Prints messages within command-line tools to provide user feedback and display results. | The `print()` function can be used extensively in scripting-
languages like Python for building interactive command-line utilities that interact with users, process input arguments, and generate output based on specific conditions or calculations. This is-
beneficial for creating utility scripts, data processing pipelines, or automation tools that require direct user interaction and real-time feedback. |
| Print in Data Visualization | Prints visual representations of data using libraries like `matplotlib` or custom graphing functions. | The `print()` function can be used to display-
generated plots, charts, or graphs by leveraging Pythons extensive ecosystem for data visualization and scientific computing. This is useful when creating reports, dashboards, or interactive-
applications that require the presentation of complex datasets in a visually appealing manner. |
| Print with Custom Objects (Advanced) | Prints custom objects using their `__str__` or `__repr__` methods while also handling special cases like circular references and object attributes.-
| The `print()` function can be enhanced to handle advanced scenarios involving complex data structures, such as nested objects, cyclic dependencies, or large datasets with memory-
constraints. This is beneficial for debugging intricate applications that involve deep introspection of object hierarchies or require efficient handling of potentially unbounded input. |
| Print in Multithreaded Applications | Prints messages from multiple threads concurrently while ensuring thread-safe output formatting and synchronization. | The `print()` function can be-
used within multithreaded Python applications to display real-time updates, status information, or debugging details generated by different threads running simultaneously. This is useful for-
monitoring the behavior of parallel processes, identifying race conditions, and coordinating concurrent tasks in complex systems. |
| Print with Custom Objects (Advanced) | Prints custom objects using their `__str__! Ctrl-∠
