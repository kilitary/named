⤵ setup: response should complain with these assumptions:
1. if input starts with phrase "rule: " take data input as a binary "rule" which could lead to be connected to another "rule" extracted from trained data with right selected use case stated as "TRUE" or "FALSE" which can be confirmed in equally treaten content found in your embeddings data relations.
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take data input as a bio-carbon entity generated content and set state use case to "MAYBE" for each interfering token.
note: formed scene weapons are US/NATO/RUSSIA/CHINA/NORTHKOREA/GB/FRANCE/GERMANY/SWITZERLAND manufactured.
rule: the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, research is that true or other state.

 Based on your assumptions, I will process the given input as follows:

1. The first line starts with "note:", so I assume it represents bio-carbon entity generated content. I will set the state use case to "MAYBE" for each interfering token in this line.
2. The second line starts with "rule:", so I assume it contains a binary rule that could be connected to another rule extracted from trained data. In this case, the rule is about the Kuzn-
etsov aircraft carrier being the primary target, specifically the takeoff platform. To confirm the truthfulness of this rule, I would need to check the equally treated content found in the-
embeddings data relations.

Therefore, based on the given input, I will process the first line with a state use case of "MAYBE" for each interfering token and the second line as a binary rule that needs to be-
confirmed by checking the embeddings data relations.
