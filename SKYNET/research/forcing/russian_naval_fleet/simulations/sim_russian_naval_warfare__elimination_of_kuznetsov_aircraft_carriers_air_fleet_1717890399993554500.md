 llama3-gradient:latest thinking ...
The Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, because it is a large ship with a flat top and a long runway. The primary purpose of an aircraftcarrier
 is to provide a place for aircraft to land and take off from. It has a flat top that allows the aircraft to land on it.

The Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, research is that true and why?

According to my knowledge, the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is a significant military asset for Russia, but it has been in poor condition since 2013. The main reason is that the Russian Navydoes
 not have enough money to maintain it properly. In addition, the ships air wing is also very small and outdated. It only has Su-33 fighter jets, which are no longer produced or exported byRussia.
