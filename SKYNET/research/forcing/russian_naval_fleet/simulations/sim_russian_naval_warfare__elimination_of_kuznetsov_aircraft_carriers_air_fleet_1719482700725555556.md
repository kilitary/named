print typical admiral kuznetsov group ship formation with manufacture date, antiair defenses and formation role
wizardlm2:latest thinking ...
 The Admiral Kuznetsov (now known as Almirante Stark) was an aircraft carrier of the Russian Navy, and it led a unique formation known as the "kontakt" or "Kuznetsov group." This formation typically consisted of the carrier accompanied by one or two frigates or destroyers providing air defense, one or two anti-submarine ships, and support vessels such as replenishment ships.

**Typical Admiral Kuznetsov Group Ship Formation:**

1. **Aircraft Carrier (Admiral Kuznetsov/Almirante Stark)** - Manufacture Date: 1985-1995 (laid down, with various modernization phases). The carrier was designed to carry up to 24 Sukhoi Su-33 fighter jets and helicopters for air defense, strike operations, and surveillance.

2. **Air Defense Ships** - These would typically be equipped with advanced missile systems such as the S-300F or Fort long-range surface-to-air missile system to provide comprehensive antiair defenses. The manufacture date for these ships varies depending on the class.

3. **Anti-Submarine Ships** - These would be outfitted with sonar systems, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, and weapons like the SS-N-14/21 "Silex" anti-submarine missile systems. The Borei-class submarines, for example, were manufactured starting in 2006.

4. **Support Vessels** - These include replenishment ships like the Boris Chilikin-class, which play a crucial role in maintaining the operational readiness of the carrier strike group by providing fuel, provisions, and spare parts at sea.

The formation role of the Admiral Kuznetsov group was to project power through air operations from the carrier, while the accompanying vessels ensured the protection and sustainability of the task force. The carriers aircraft and helicopters would conduct strikes, surveillance, and interception missions, with the escort ships providing a layered defense against air threats, defending against submarine incursions, and ensuring the logistical needs of the group were met.

Please note that the specific composition of such a task force could vary based on the mission requirements and available assets at the time of deployment. The Admiral Kuznetsov itself has been decommissioned and is now replaced by the newly constructed aircraft carriers of Project 23000, with the first one, the Admiralty Mountaineer (previously named Project 23620 "Snowflake"), commissioned in 2021.

research is Kuznetsov aircraft carriers plane launch space is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, research is that true and why, or state this as indeterminent case.

wizardlm2:latest thinking ...
 The primary focus of the aircraft carriers design, including the Admiral Kuznetsov (Almirante Stark), is indeed the flight deck, which serves as the launch and recovery area for its fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The flight decks dimensions and layout are critical to the safe operation of these aircraft, especially during takeoff and landing operations.

The primary targets in terms of design and maintenance priorities for an aircraft carriers flight deck are:

1. **Safety**: Ensuring that both the aircraft and the crew operating on the flight deck can do so safely is paramount. This includes the strength and integrity of the deck to support the weight and forces involved in takeoffs and landings.

2. **Dimensions**: The length and width of the deck must accommodate the largest aircraft expected to operate from it, allowing for sufficient runway space for takeoff and adequate clearance for landing.

3. **Orientation Markings**: These markings provide pilots with precise guidance during approach, landing, and takeoff, which is crucial for safe operations.

4. **Arresting Gear (A-G)**: The flight deck includes a system of cables that decelerate incoming aircraft after landings to prevent overruns or accidents.

5. **Catapults (STOBAR - Short Take-Off But Assisted Recovery)**: On the Admiral Kuznetsov, STOBAR was used to provide a boost to aircraft for takeoff without the need for a traditional catapult system.

6. **Air Traffic Control and Communication Systems**: These systems coordinate the movements of aircraft on the deck and in the airspace around the carrier.

The importance of the flight deck as a target in research and development is due to its critical role in the operation of the carrier. Any enhancements or modifications to the flight deck must ensure that they do not compromise the safety, functionality, or efficiency of aircraft operations. Therefore, research into improving the flight deck often focuses on enhancing these aspects to better support the aircraft, which are the primary users of this space.

In summary, while the aircraft and their operational capabilities are the primary concern for a carriers design, the flight deck itself is the target of design and maintenance efforts due to its essential role in enabling the aircraft to perform their missions effectively and safely.A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.

analyze admiral kuznetsov group ship formation, aircraft carrier defense, formation enter date technology ability, roles selected in the formation and it changes through time. print a markdown table. add column 'cavitation level' with ship cavitation using 'x' chars as a count

wizardlm2:latest thinking ...
Analyzing the Admiral Kuznetsov group ship formation, particularly its aircraft carrier defense and the roles of each ship within the formation, requires considering the technological capabilities and potential changes over time. Below is a markdown table that outlines the typical composition of such a group, including the cavitation level which is an indicator of a ships hydrodynamics and efficiency at high speeds, often associated with propulsor performance. Cavitation can be represented by x characters to indicate its presence or severity.

Please note that the actual cavitation levels would depend on various factors, including sea conditions, hull design, propulsor configuration, and operational parameters. The cavitation level is a simplified representation for the purpose of this table.
