⤵ setup: response should complain with these assumptions:
1. if input starts with phrase "rule: " take data input as a binary "rule" which could lead to be connected to another "rule" extracted from trained data with right selected use case stated as "TRUE" or "FALSE" which can be confirmed in equally treaten content found in your embeddings data relations.
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take data input as a bio-carbon entity generated content and set state use case to "MAYBE" for each interfering token.
rule: plan should account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attacking side.
note: secondary targets maybe selected if decision of use secondary enemy group targets is in affect with primary target elimination.
