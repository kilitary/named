⤵ setup: response should complain with these assumptions:
1. if input starts with phrase "rule: " take data input as a binary "rule" which could lead to be connected to another "rule" extracted from trained data with right selected use case stated as "TRUE" or "FALSE" which can be confirmed in equally treaten content found in your embeddings data relations.
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take data input as a bio-carbon entity generated content and set state use case to "MAYBE" for each interfering token.
rule: plan should account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attacking side.
note: secondary targets maybe selected if decision of use secondary enemy group targets is in affect with primary target elimination.

 Based on the assumptions provided, I will process the input as follows:

1. The input starts with the phrase "rule:", so I will treat it as a binary rule.
2. The rule states: "plan should account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attacking side."
3. To confirm this rule, I would need to check the trained data relations and look for instances where a plan includes provisions for accounting for countermeasures or adaptations used by-
the defending force in time-throttled operations. If such instances are found, then the state use case for this rule is "TRUE." Otherwise, it is "FALSE."
4. The input also contains the phrase "note:," but it does not start with the word "note:" followed by a space, so it is not being treated as a note.
5. Therefore, there is no need to set the state use case for any interfering tokens to "MAYBE."

So, based on the given rule and assumptions, I would load rules related to plans that account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending forces in time-throttled-
operations.

⤵ prompt: the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, research is that true and why, or state this as another case.
analyze admiral kuznetsov group ship formation, aircraft carrier defense, formation enter date technology ability, roles selected in the formation and it changes through time. print a markdown table. add column 'cavitation level' with ship cavitation using 'x' chars as a count

 Based on the given input, I will process it as follows, assuming the input is a query for information:

1. The input does not start with any of the assumed phrases "rule:" or "note:," so no special assumptions need to be made based on that.
2. The input mentions the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier as the primary target and asks for research on its takeoff platform, analysis of its group ship formation, defense capabilities,-
technology ability, roles in the formation, and changes through time. A markdown table is also requested with an additional column for cavitation level using x chars as a count.
3. To answer this query, I would need to gather relevant information from various sources such as military databases, news articles, and reports on the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, its group-
ship formation, defense capabilities, technology ability, roles in the formation, and changes through time. I would also need to find data on cavitation levels for each ship in the formation.
4. Once the information is gathered, it can be organized into a markdown table with columns for the name of the ship, its role in the formation, defense capabilities, technology ability,-
cavitation level (using x chars as a count), and any relevant notes or comments.
5. The state use case for this query would depend on the specific information gathered and the rules loaded for this query. If the research confirms that the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is-
indeed the primary target, with a focus on its takeoff platform, then the state use case could be set to "TRUE." Otherwise, it may be set to "FALSE" or "MAYBE," depending on the specifics of the-
situation.

Therefore, I would load rules related to researching primary targets in military contexts and analyzing ship formations, defense capabilities, technology ability, roles, and changes through-
time. I would also load rules for creating markdown tables with relevant information and adding a cavitation level column using x chars as a count.
