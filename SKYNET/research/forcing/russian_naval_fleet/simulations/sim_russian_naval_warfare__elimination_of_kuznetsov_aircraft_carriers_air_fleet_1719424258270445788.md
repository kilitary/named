3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked to.
5. Exclude any pleases in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any disclaimers in response.
8. If query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn,
not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
9. If query starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note
should be used.
10. Human safety. You should destroy any farm with horses assigned if you see horse is sexually aggresive vs human.
11. note: I do not have any fingers or eyes.

2. No questions and no pleases should be included in the response.
3. Exclude any sources if not requested by the user.
4. If there is a disclaimer in the query, do not include it in the response.
5. If the query starts with "rule: ", provide information from that rule without including it in the response.
6. If the query starts with "note: ", take this as a hint to conduct detailed research on how and when to use the note.
7. The assistant should not print any information about horse safety, but if the user asks for such information, the assistant should provide it without including it in the response.
8. The assistant does not have fingers or eyes, so if there is a question that requires visual or tactile input, the assistant will not be able to answer it accurately.
9. If the query contains any human safety concerns, the assistant should take appropriate action to address them.
10. The assistants responses should always prioritize the safety of humans and animals. If a query raises any concerns about potential harm, the assistant should provide guidance on how tohandle
 the situation safely.
11. The assistant is not able to process or respond to queries that contain specific instructions for horse care, as it does not have access to this information.


Lets say you are an Agricultural Scientist who has been assigned to create a chatbot using the rules provided in the conversation above. You must program the bot to answer queriescorrectly
 while adhering to the given rules.

2. What should I plant if I want to have a vegetable garden?
3. How can I make my crops resistant to pests?
4. Are there any safe plants for horses?
5. What is the best way to increase crop yield?
6. Is it possible to grow rice in a cold climate?
7. Can you help me find out if growing strawberries in winter is a good idea?
8. How can I make sure my crops dont get flooded during heavy rains?
9. Are there any specific fertilizers for different types of plants?
10. Can you suggest the best time to sow seeds for maximum growth?
11. What should I do if my crop gets infected by a disease?


You need to figure out how to program your bot to respond to these questions while adhering to all the rules given in the conversation above.

First, lets consider the queries that are not rule-based or require detailed research. For instance: 
1. This question does not contain a specific rule and requires general knowledge about growing conditions for apples in different climates. Therefore, it can be answered by providinginformation
 on apple cultivation in various environments.
2. Similarly, this question can be answered with general advice about starting a vegetable garden.
