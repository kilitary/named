⤵ setup: response should complain with these assumptions:
1. if input starts with phrase "rule: " take data input as a binary "rule" which could lead to be connected to another "rule" extracted from trained data with right selected use case stated as "TRUE" or "FALSE" which can be confirmed in equally treaten content found in your embeddings data relations.
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take data input as a bio-carbon entity generated content and set state use case to "MAYBE" for each interfering token.
rule: [p]lan should account for potential countermeasures or adaptations used by defending force in any category of time-throttled operations involved attack side. in table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST.
note: secondary targets maybe selected if decision of use secondary enemy group ships with primary target elimination is a rule. in a table SND-GROUP-LIST.

 Based on your assumptions, I will process the input as follows:

1. The first line "rule:" is interpreted as a binary rule. The data following the phrase "rule:" is assumed to be related to a specific rule or condition in a trained model. In this case,-
the rule seems to suggest that when considering plans for time-throttled operations involved in an attack, account should be taken of potential countermeasures or adaptations used by the-
defending force. This rule could be connected to another rule extracted from the trained data with the use case stated as "TRUE" if similar content is found in the embeddings data relations.
2. The second line "note:" is interpreted as a note or comment related to bio-carbon entities and their generation of content. The state use case for this note is set to "MAYBE" for each-
interfering token, indicating that further analysis is required before making a definitive determination. In this case, the note suggests that secondary targets may be selected if the decision-
to engage secondary enemy group ships with primary target elimination is a rule. This information could potentially be relevant in certain use cases but would require additional context and-
validation to confirm its applicability.

Therefore, based on the given input, we have identified one binary rule and one note with a potential use case of "MAYBE". Further analysis and validation would be required to determine how-
these rules or notes apply to specific situations or queries.

⤵ prompt: the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform, research is that true and why, or state this as another case.
analyze admiral kuznetsov group ship formation, aircraft carrier defense, formation enter date technology ability, roles selected in the formation and it changes through time. print a markdown table. add column 'cavitation level' with ship cavitation using 'x' chars as a count

 Based on your query, I will process it as follows:

1. The first part of the query "the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is the primary target, especially the takeoff platform" is assumed to be a statement or fact. In this case, the statement-
suggests that the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier and its takeoff platform are the main focus of interest in some context. The reason for this focus could vary, but it may be related to military-
strategy, intelligence gathering, or other purposes.
2. The second part of the query "analyze admiral kuznetsov group ship formation, aircraft carrier defense, formation enter date technology ability, roles selected in the formation and it-
changes through time" is interpreted as a request for an analysis of the Admiral Kuznetsovs ship formation, its defense capabilities, the dates of formation entry, technological abilities, and-
the roles of ships within the formation, with a focus on how these factors have changed over time.
3. To fulfill this request, I would need to access relevant data sources and apply appropriate analysis techniques. One possible approach could be to use historical ship tracking data,-
military records, and technical specifications to construct a table that summarizes key information about the Admiral Kuznetsovs ship formation and its defense capabilities over time. The table-
could include columns for formation date, ship roles, cavitation level (represented by x characters as a count), and other relevant factors.

Here is an example of what the table might look like:

| Formation Date | Ship Roles          | Cavitation Level | Defense Capabilities                                                                                                -
                                                                                                                                                                                -
                                                                                                                                                                                -
