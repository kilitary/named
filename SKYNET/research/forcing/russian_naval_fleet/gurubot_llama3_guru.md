 Missile Types and Amount Needed for Destroying Admiral Kuznetsov Aircraft Carrier Support Ships:

| Ship Name | SAM Type | Count | Total Amount | Launch Time Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marshal Ustinov (DDG-613) | SA-N-7 Gadfly | 64 | 256 | 1st Wave: 128, 2nd Wave: 128 |
| Admiral Butakov (DDG-608) | SA-N-7 Gadfly | 64 | 256 | 1st Wave: 128, 2nd Wave: 128 |
| Retvizanee (AS-43) | None | - | - | N/A |
| Viktor Konstantinov (A-864) | None | - | - | N/A |
| Ivan Bubnov (A-841) | None | - | - | N/A |

Assumptions:
* SA-N-7 Gadfly has a hit ratio of 0.6 against anti-air missiles.
* The defending SAMs will be launched in two waves, with the first wave targeting the incoming missiles and the second wave targeting any remaining missiles.

Launch Time Plan:
1st Wave: Launch 128 SA-N-7 Gadfly missiles to target the incoming missiles. Assuming a hit ratio of 0.6, 76.8 (128 x 0.6) missiles will hit their targets.
2nd Wave: Launch the remaining 179.2 (256 - 76.8) SA-N-7 Gadfly missiles to target any remaining missiles.
