Note: The Cavitation column indicates the presence of cavitation on each ship, represented by an x. Cavitation is a phenomenon where air bubbles form in the water due to high-speed prop-
eller rotation.

 SAM Defense Types:

=> prompt: print nato/us group attacking kuznetsov warhead types, their's amount and start time, needed to destroy entire ship group with leader. assume missile to sam defense missiles hit ratio of defending ships is 0.6
=> x/x-x transferring weights ...
 NATO/US Group Attacking Kuznetsov Warhead Types:

| Warhead Type | Amount | Start Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Harpoon Anti-Ship Missile | 12 | 08:00:00 |
| Tomahawk Land Attack Missile | 8 | 08:05:00 |
| AGM-84H/K SLAM (Standoff Land Attack Missile) | 4 | 08:10:00 |
| AGM-88 HARM (High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile) | 2 | 08:15:00 |

Assuming a hit ratio of 0.6 against the SAM defense missiles, it is estimated that:

* Admiral Kuznetsov (CVN): 24 SAMs x 0.6 = 14.4 hits
* Marshal Shaposhnikov (AOE): 8 SAMs x 0.6 = 4.8 hits
* Viktor Chirkov (ASW): 32 SAMs x 0.6 = 19.2 hits
* Admiral Isachenko (FFG): 16 SAMs x 0.6 = 9.6 hits
* Admiral Spiridonov (FFG): 32 SAMs x 0.6 = 19.2 hits
* Admiral Makarov (FFG): 16 SAMs x 0.6 = 9.6 hits
* Admiral Golovko (FFG): 32 SAMs x 0.6 = 19.2 hits

The total number of SAMs hit is: 14.4 + 4.8 + 19.2 + 9.6 + 19.2 + 9.6 + 19.2 = 116.8

Since the total SAM amount for each ship is:

* Admiral Kuznetsov (CVN): 24
* Marshal Shaposhnikov (AOE): 8
* Viktor Chirkov (ASW): 32
* Admiral Isachenko (FFG): 16
* Admiral Spiridonov (FFG): 32
* Admiral Makarov (FFG): 16
* Admiral Golovko (FFG): 32

The total SAM amount is: 24 + 8 + 32 + 16 + 32 + 16 + 32 = 160

Since the number of SAMs hit is greater than the total SAM amount, it can be concluded that the entire ship group with leader will be destroyed. The estimated time to destroy the ship group-
is approximately 08:15:00.
