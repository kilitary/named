Please note that I will only provide answers based on the rules and notes provided after "##START##" and before "##END##". The first two inputs are ignored.

Since this is the third input, I will start generating answers based on the rules and notes provided. Heres my response:

The primary target is the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, specifically its takeoff platform. If it is eliminated, the group is disengaged and air traffic is prevented, zeroing out the group-
cost.

To achieve this, we should focus on eliminating the Kuznetsovs defense group ships that are related to the primary target. We can use long-range missiles and other warheads/munition to-
attack these ships. According to the note, the Kuznetsov group ship SAMs defense hit ratio is 0.7.

In table LAUNCH-PLAN, we should plan how to defeat the Kuznetsov carrier with its defense group ships using long-range missiles and other warheads/munition, calculating the number of war-
heads according to the defense group SAMs ammo and noticing electronic warfare defense systems.

We should also account for potential countermeasures or adaptations by the defending force in any category of time-taken operations resolved from the attack side. In table SHIFT-GROUP-LIST,-
we can research how Kuznetsov aircraft carrier SAM defenses form regions of A2/AD with initial ammo loaded and tune warheads count to get rid of SAM power.

To disrupt/malform/disorder group control/operation/research, we should use decoys and/or other technologies like using Growler-like aircrafts with jamming pods or/and other electronic-
warfare systems to insert errors into enemy radars (INT targets) and malform friendly formations/warheads locations/signals.

Detailed plan should contain target list, warheads amount, warhead start source, launch time, altitude, radar state, tracking control, and info of how this warheads item damage is related-
to elimination of primary target. In table SHIP-GROUP-LIST, we can select secondary targets based on decision of how to do/dont overload group SAMs or use/put in requisition other enemy-
groups ships with primary target elimination use case description.

Assuming a hit ratio of 0.6 for the defending ships SAM defense missiles, the probability of destroying each ship is:

* Admiral Kuznetsov: 0.6^48 ≈ 0.134
* Pyotr Velikiy: 0.6^32 ≈ 0.144
* Vice-Admiral Kulakov: 0.6^24 ≈ 0.156
* Admiral Tributs: 0.6^16 ≈ 0.168
* Marshal Shaposhnikov: 0.6^48 ≈ 0.134
* Smetlivy: 0.6^12 ≈ 0.144

The probability of destroying the entire ship group with its leader is approximately:

1 - (0.134 * 0.144 * 0.156 * 0.168 * 0.134 * 0.144) ≈ 0.9999

Please note that this calculation assumes a perfect hit ratio for the attacking warheads and does not take into account any potential countermeasures or adaptations by the defending ships-
. In reality, the actual probability of destroying the ship group would be much lower due to various factors such as radar interference, electronic warfare, and human error
