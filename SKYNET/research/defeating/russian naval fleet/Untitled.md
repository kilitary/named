* Missile Selection:
	+ RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile (US)
	+ Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) Block IV (US)

		- Simultaneously, launch 2-3 TLAMs against the Slava-class cruisers.
	+ Phase 2: Secondary Engagement
		- After the initial engagement, re-target the remaining missiles at the Krivak-class frigates and Kirov-class destroyer.
			* Launch 4-6 RGM-84 Harpoons against each of the frigates (16-24 total).
			+ Launch 2-3 TLAMs against the Kirov-class destroyer.
	+ Phase 3: Counter-Measure Response

		- Use electronic warfare (EW) capabilities to disrupt the enemy's radar and communication systems.

* Launch Time Plan:
	+ Phase 1: Initial Engagement - 0-5 minutes
		- RGM-84 Harpoons: 4-6 missiles, spaced 10 seconds apart
		- TLAMs: 2-3 missiles, spaced 15 seconds apart
	+ Phase 2: Secondary Engagement - 5-15 minutes
		- RGM-84 Harpoons: 16-24 missiles, spaced 10 seconds apart (4-6 per frigate)
		- TLAMs: 2-3 missiles, spaced 15 seconds apart (1 destroyer)
	+ Phase 3: Counter-Measure Response - 15-30 minutes
		- Decoy missiles: 8-12, spaced 5 seconds apart
		- EW capabilities: continuous jamming of enemy radar and communication systems

* Number of Missiles Required to Destroy the Group:
	+ Kuznetsov Aircraft Carrier: 6-8 RGM-84 Harpoons or 4-6 TLAMs
	+ Slava-class Cruisers: 2-3 TLAMs each (6-9 total)
	+ Krivak-class Frigates: 16-24 RGM-84 Harpoons (64-96 total)
	+ Kirov-class Destroyer: 2-3 TLAMs
* Total Missiles Required: 94-144

Note: The above plan is a theoretical scenario and should not be used in real-world military operations. The actual number of missiles required may vary depending on the-
specific circumstances of the engagement. The effectiveness of the attack plan will depend on various factors, including the accuracy of the missile guidance systems, the enemy-
's defensive capabilities, and the weather conditions.

To defeat the Kuznetsov carrier with its defense group ships using long-range missiles while avoiding entering its surface-to-air range, we will use a combination of tactics and-
technologies to overwhelm their defenses and achieve mission success. The plan will be divided into several stages:

Stage 1: Intelligence Gathering
- Gather as much information as possible about the Kuznetsov carrier, its defense group ships, and their current location, speed, and course.
- Identify potential weaknesses in their formation and defensive capabilities.

Stage 2: Preparing for Attack
- Determine the optimal launch position to minimize risk from surface-to-air missiles while maintaining a long-range attack capability.
- Calculate the number of missiles needed to achieve full destruction of the group. This will depend on the size of the defense group, but a minimum of four missiles per ship should be used-
to ensure complete destruction.

Stage 3: Launching Missiles
- Deploy multiple missile launch platforms (e.g., ships or submarines) to simultaneously attack the Kuznetsov carrier and its defense group ships.
- Use advanced guidance systems and decoys to confuse and overwhelm the enemy's anti-missile defenses. Consider employing technologies like the EA-18G Growler's electronic warfare-
capabilities to disrupt enemy radar and control systems.

Stage 4: Countermeasures
- Anticipate potential countermeasures or adaptations by the defending force, such as altering course or deploying additional defensive assets.
- Adjust the attack plan accordingly, potentially involving more missile launch platforms or modifying the missile trajectories to avoid enemy defenses.

Stage 5: Destroying Each Ship
- Calculate a detailed plan for destroying each ship in the Kuznetsov's defense group. This will involve coordinating missile strikes on each vessel while avoiding countermeasures and-
minimizing losses.
- Use only US/NATO warheads and hardware to ensure compatibility with support systems and minimize potential issues during recovery.

Stage 6: Post-Attack Assessment
- Conduct a thorough assessment of the attack's effectiveness, including analyzing damage done to each ship and determining if any vessels were able to escape or retaliate.
- Adjust future plans as needed based on lessons learned from this engagement.

Stage 3: Launching Missiles

During this stage, we will deploy multiple missile launch platforms simultaneously to attack the Kuznetsov carrier and its defense group ships while maintaining a long-range attack-
capability.

1. Determine Optimal Launch Position:
- Gather intelligence on the enemy's current location, speed, and course.
- Identify potential weaknesses in their formation and defensive capabilities.
- Choose an optimal launch position that minimizes risk from surface-to-air missiles while maintaining a long-range attack capability.

2. Calculate Number of Missiles Needed:
- Determine the size of the defense group and calculate the minimum number of missiles needed to achieve full destruction (at least four missiles per ship).
- Consider employing technologies like the EA-18G Growler's electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt enemy radar and control systems, increasing the chances of successful missile launches.

3. Deploy Missile Launch Platforms:
- Utilize ships, submarines, or other platforms capable of launching long-range missiles.
- Coordinate simultaneous attacks on multiple targets within the defense group to overwhelm their defenses and increase the likelihood of mission success.

4. Use Advanced Guidance Systems and Decoys:
- Employ advanced guidance systems for missiles to improve accuracy and maximize damage to target vessels.
- Utilize decoys to confuse and overwhelm enemy anti-missile defenses, increasing the chances of successful missile launches.

5. Monitor Countermeasures and Adjust Plan Accordingly:
- Anticipate potential countermeasures or adaptations by the defending force (e.g., altering course or deploying additional defensive assets).
- Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the attack plan and adjust as needed to overcome enemy defenses and achieve mission success.

6. Destroy Each Ship in Defense Group:
- Coordinate missile strikes on each vessel while avoiding countermeasures and minimizing losses.
- Use only US/NATO warheads and hardware to ensure compatibility with support systems and minimize potential issues during recovery.

7. Conduct Post-Attack Assessment:
- Analyze damage done to each ship and determine if any vessels were able to escape or retaliate.
- Adjust future plans as needed based on lessons learned from this engagement.
