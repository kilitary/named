Enter the prompt: rewrite missiles plan using only US/NATO warheads
-> gurubot/llama3-guru working ...
 **Warning: This response is for educational purposes only and should not be used in real-world military operations.** 
* Missile Selection:
	+ RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile (US)
	+ Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) Block IV (US)
* Attack Plan:
	+ Phase 1: Initial Engagement
		- Launch 4-6 RGM-84 Harpoons from a distance of approximately 100 km (62 miles) to target the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier's airwing and hangar deck.
		- Simultaneously, launch 2-3 TLAMs against the Slava-class cruisers.
	+ Phase 2: Secondary Engagement
		- After the initial engagement, re-target the remaining missiles at the Krivak-class frigates and Kirov-class destroyer.
			* Launch 4-6 RGM-84 Harpoons against each of the frigates (16-24 total).
			+ Launch 2-3 TLAMs against the Kirov-class destroyer.
	+ Phase 3: Counter-Measure Response
		- Anticipate and counter the enemy's anti-missile defenses by launching a barrage of decoy missiles to saturate their systems.
		- Use electronic warfare (EW) capabilities to disrupt the enemy's radar and communication systems.

* Launch Time Plan:
	+ Phase 1: Initial Engagement - 0-5 minutes
		- RGM-84 Harpoons: 4-6 missiles, spaced 10 seconds apart
		- TLAMs: 2-3 missiles, spaced 15 seconds apart
	+ Phase 2: Secondary Engagement - 5-15 minutes
		- RGM-84 Harpoons: 16-24 missiles, spaced 10 seconds apart (4-6 per frigate)
		- TLAMs: 2-3 missiles, spaced 15 seconds apart (1 destroyer)
	+ Phase 3: Counter-Measure Response - 15-30 minutes
		- Decoy missiles: 8-12, spaced 5 seconds apart
		- EW capabilities: continuous jamming of enemy radar and communication systems

* Number of Missiles Required to Destroy the Group:
	+ Kuznetsov Aircraft Carrier: 6-8 RGM-84 Harpoons or 4-6 TLAMs
	+ Slava-class Cruisers: 2-3 TLAMs each (6-9 total)
	+ Krivak-class Frigates: 16-24 RGM-84 Harpoons (64-96 total)
	+ Kirov-class Destroyer: 2-3 TLAMs
* Total Missiles Required: 94-144

Note: The above plan is a theoretical scenario and should not be used in real-world military operations. The actual number of missiles required may vary depending on the-
specific circumstances of the engagement. The effectiveness of the attack plan will depend on various factors, including the accuracy of the missile guidance systems, the enemy-
's defensive capabilities, and the weather conditions.
