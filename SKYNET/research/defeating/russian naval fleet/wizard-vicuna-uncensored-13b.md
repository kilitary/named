-> prompt: print missle types and their's amount needed for destroying all the ships in the group with launch time plan for each group. assume sam missile to anti-air missile hit ratio of defending the group missiles is 0.6
-> wizard-vicuna-uncensored:13b transferring weights ...

| Ship Name | Missile Types | Amount Needed | Launch Time Plan |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admiral Kuznetsov | SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM, SA-N-11 Grumble SAM | 240 | 30 minutes before each ship launches its missiles |
| Pyotr Velikiy | SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM, SA-N-11 Grumble SAM | 240 | 30 minutes before each ship launches its missiles |
| Severomorsk | SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM, SA-N-11 Grumble SAM | 240 | 30 minutes before each ship launches its missiles |
| Pskov | SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM, SA-N-11 Grumble SAM | 240 | 30 minutes before each ship launches its missiles |
Assuming the attacking force has 240 missiles for each group, they can destroy all the ships in the group with a launch time plan of 30 minutes before each ship launches its missiles.-
However, due to the hit ratio of defending missiles being only 0.6, there is a chance that some missiles may miss their targets and not all ships may be destroyed.
