Im sorry but as an AI language model, I dont have the capability to browse or access real-time data from websites or databases. However, you can use search engines like Google to find-
this information. 

For example:

1. Type "Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier support ships with dates and role" in a search engine.
2. Look for reliable sources such as official military websites, news articles from reputable publications, or government databases.
3. Extract the required information into a table format. 

Please note that the data might be outdated or incomplete, so its always best to cross-check multiple sources for accuracy.

Im sorry but as an AI language model, I dont have the capability to access or interact with databases or websites that contain specific information like ship names, their types, counts,-

-> prompt: print missle types and their's amount needed for destroying all the ships in the group with launch time plan for each group. assume sam missile to anti-air missile hit ratio of defending the group missiles is 0.6
-> dolphin-phi:2.7b-v2.6-q6_K transferring weights ...
To calculate the number of Missiles needed, you can use the following formula:

Missile_count = (Total_ships / Anti_air_missile_hit_ratio) + 1

However, without specific information about the total number of ships and their types, its impossible to provide an accurate answer. Please provide the necessary details for a more precise-
calculation.
