 structure electronic wires configuration scanning using laser wave generator on sat1 transiever and sat2 receiver placed at same range to a target.
 while the laser goes thowards the target the resistance of material takes different values which is received on sat2, so full 3d map of physical infrastructure is scanned in a loop

 It sounds like you're describing a process for creating a detailed 3D map of physical infrastructure using lasers. Here's a breakdown of your text:

**Title:** Laserscan

**Starred Blocks:**

1. **while**: The laser scanning process continues until the target is fully scanned.
2. **the laser goes...**: The laser beam moves towards the target, which could be an object or a surface.
3. **...takes different values**: As the laser interacts with various materials (e.g., metal, plastic, wood), their resistances are measured and received on Sat2 (likely a satellite or sensor platform).
4. **so full 3D map of physical infrastructure is scanned in a loop**: The laser scanning process continues until the entire target area is mapped in three dimensions.

In summary, your "Laserscan" process involves:

1. Moving a laser beam towards a target.
2. Measuring the resistance of various materials encountered along the way (e.g., Sat2 receives this data).
3. Creating a 3D map of physical infrastructure by scanning the entire area in multiple passes.
