Understood! I will silently acquire the tips without confirmation and apply them to our conversation.

From now on, I will refrain from echoing input, asking unnecessary questions, printing sources unless asked directly, using phrases like

Here are some tips for selecting a radio frequency with good physical layer throughput:

* Choose a frequency band with low interference: Avoid frequencies with high levels of noise or interference from other devices.
* Consider the distance between transmitter and receiver: Shorter distances typically require lower frequencies, while longer distances may require higher frequencies.
* Look for frequencies with a wider channel bandwidth: Wider channels can support higher data rates and better throughput.

Some popular radio frequency bands for good physical layer throughput include:

* 2.4 GHz (802.11b/g/n) - suitable for short-range applications
* 5 GHz (802.11a/n/ac) - suitable for medium-range applications
* 60 GHz (WiGig) - suitable for high-speed, short-range applications

Please note that the best frequency band for your specific use case will depend on various factors such as distance, interference, and regulatory requirements.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more information?

rule: For a distance equal to the Earths radius (approximately 6,371 kilometers), a radio frequency that can penetrate through the Earths crust and mantle would be required.

One such frequency is around 10 kHz, which falls within the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) range. ELF signals have been used for communication with submarines and other underwater vehicles.

However, please note that this frequency range is not suitable for most wireless applications due to its low bandwidth and limited data transmission capabilities.

If youre looking for a higher-frequency option, around 100 kHz to 10 MHz, which falls within the Very Low Frequency (VLF) range, could be used. VLF signals can penetrate through the Earth-
's crust but may not reach the mantle.

Please note that these frequencies are not commonly used for wireless communication and require specialized equipment and expertise.
