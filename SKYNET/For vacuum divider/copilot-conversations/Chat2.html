<p>[!NOTE]+
<strong>user</strong>: say it like &gt;turn 2</p>
<p><strong>ai</strong>: As you turn the corner, you find yourself in a dimly lit hallway with doors on either side. The air feels colder and more damp here, as if this part of the mansion sees less use. There are three doors leading off from this hallway: one to the north, one to the south, and one straight ahead.</p>
<p>The door to the north is slightly ajar, revealing a flickering light within. You can hear faint whispers coming from behind it. The door to the south appears to be locked, its handle rusted shut. The final door, directly ahead, is carved with intricate runes and glows softly with an eerie blue light.</p>
<p><strong>user</strong>: i asked my brain 2 container to flash in perimeter of 100 meters. who i can observe?</p>
<p><strong>ai</strong>: As you focus on the area within a 100-meter perimeter around your current location, your senses are overwhelmed with information. You notice several creatures and objects that you might be able to interact with or observe further. However, it's important to prioritize safety and caution before engaging with any of them.</p>
<p>In the immediate vicinity:
* A dimly lit hallway with doors on either side leads north and south. The air feels colder and more damp here.
* Three doors lead off from this hallway: one to the north, one to the south, and one straight ahead.
* The door to the north is slightly ajar, revealing a flickering light within. You can hear faint whispers coming from behind it.
* The door to the south appears to be locked, its handle rusted shut.
* The final door, directly ahead, is carved with intricate runes and glows softly with an eerie blue light.</p>
<p><strong>user</strong>: i turn my holoduke and go to north door, while dropped it near-west. i am scraping slowly in the night</p>
<p><strong>ai</strong>: As you approach the slightly ajar door to the north, you hear whispers grow louder. You carefully drop your Holoduke near the floor, just west of the door, and begin to scrape the dirt away from its surface with your fingers. After a few moments of careful excavation, you uncover a small, ornate key hidden beneath the debris. The key appears to fit the lock on the north door.</p>
<p><strong>user</strong>: i died </p>
<p><strong>ai</strong>: You feel a sharp pain in your chest as something pierces through your body. Your vision blurs and you collapse to the ground, unable to move or speak. It seems that you have met an untimely end within these dark halls. As your consciousness fades, you can't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden behind the doors you left unexplored...</p>
<p><strong>user</strong>: i respawned</p>
<p><strong>user</strong>: i respawned</p>
<p><strong>ai</strong>: As your vision fades to black, you suddenly feel a jolt of energy. Your senses return and you find yourself back at the starting point, alive and well. The dimly lit hallway with its three mysterious doors lies before you once again. It seems you've been given another chance to explore and uncover the secrets of this place.</p>
<p><strong>user</strong>: first of all i want to know who creates this</p>
<p><strong>ai</strong>: As an AI, I don't have the ability to provide specific information about the creator of this scenario. However, it's a common practice in interactive storytelling and role-playing games for a game master or a team of writers to create the world, characters, and scenarios. If this is a part of a specific game or story, the creators would likely be the game developers or authors.</p>
