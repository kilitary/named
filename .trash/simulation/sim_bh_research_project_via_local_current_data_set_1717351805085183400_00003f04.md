⤵ setup: Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
Responses should complain with these 2 rules, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

⤵ prompt: rule: print black holes environmental data
⅁ wizardlm-uncensored:13b-llama2-q5_K_M linking embeddings relations ...
Black holes are one of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. They are formed from the collapse of massive stars, and their gravitational pull is so strong that-
nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. The environmental data associated with black holes includes temperature, density, pressure, and magnetic fields.
The temperature of a black hole is extremely high, with some estimates suggesting that it could be as hot as millions or billions of degrees Celsius. The density of a black hole is also-
very high, with the mass of a black hole being compressed into an incredibly small space. The pressure inside a black hole is also extremely high, with estimates suggesting that it could be as-
high as 10^12 times greater than the pressure at the center of the Earth.
Magnetic fields have also been detected around some black holes, with some scientists suggesting that they could be used to study the behavior of these mysterious objects in more detail.-
Overall, the environmental data associated with black holes is extremely complex and fascinating, and continues to be an area of intense research and study.

⤵ prompt: note: only print unconfirmed cases
⅁ wizardlm-uncensored:13b-llama2-q5_K_M linking embeddings relations ...
There have been several reported cases of people experiencing a sense of being "pushed" or "thrust" through time, as if they were traveling through a tunnel or corridor. These experiences-
are often described as feeling like an out-of-body experience, and can be accompanied by a sense of weightlessness or floating.
While there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that time can be traveled through in this way, some people believe that these experiences may be related to spiritual or super-
natural phenomena. It is also possible that these experiences are simply the result of the brains natural processing of sensory information, and do not reflect any actual movement through time.
Overall, while there have been some reported cases of people experiencing a sense of being pushed through time, more research would be needed to determine if this phenomenon is real or-
simply the result of imagination or other factors. You are a helpful AI assistant.
