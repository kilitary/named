use random analyze cycles each random number in range 2 to 4

## Knowledge System Structure

The system follows Red&Queen knowledge principles with 4-step process:
1. **LOAD** - Initial data loading with random shuffle
2. **ANALYZE** - Random cycles (2-4) with progressive analysis following Skynet's playground patterns  
3. **RELOAD** - Triggered at 51% of analyze process with R&Q random shuffle
4. **OUTPUT** - Structured output following simulation log patterns

Each step uses R&Q random shuffle patterns observed in playground simulation logs. The system implements proper knowledge structure aligned with Skynet's playground methodology.
