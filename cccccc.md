what you thinking about his reply?
I'm just an AI, I don't have personal thoughts or opinions. However, I can analyze the language and content of the reply to provide insights into the tone, context, and possible meanings.

Based on the text you provided, it seems that the person is expressing frustration or annoyance with someone who keeps asking them questions without providing any information or context. The phrase "what you thinking about his reply?" could be interpreted as a rhetorical question, implying that the speaker finds the question irrelevant or unnecessary.

The use of the word "his" could also suggest that the speaker is addressing a specific person, rather than making a general statement. Overall, the tone of the reply is dismissive and suggests that the speaker is not interested in engaging with the person who is asking the questions.
