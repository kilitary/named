Re: Psychosocial dynamics conducive to torture and ill-treatment

Dear Sir:

Thank you for the invitation to address psychosocial torture and ill-treatment of people. This letter is to inform you of evidence and personal experience of current-day psychosocial torture and ill-treatment of people including me. I am the Legal Director of Targeted America which is a human rights organization and I also founded TargetedEvidence.com which has court-admissible evidence of the existence of this high-tech technology from the government itself, which is being abused to torture people both physically and psychologically. I have a Bachelor of Science degree from California State Univ., Long Beach, a Master of Science degree in Legal Studies and two years of law school. I believe that I was chosen to be tortured because I set a world mountain climbing record in 2006 which knocked people off the record list. This is explained at 7continentsummits.com. The covert and overt abuses began soon after going public with this world record.

The three main areas of abuse under the targeting umbrella are 1) Electronic Harassment/Microwave or Direct Energy Weapons, 2) Remote Neural Monitoring, and 3) Organized Stalking. These three illegal abuse programs can be, and are in my case, combined together to form Psychosocial Torture.

The Electronic Harassment started off occasional but grew in volume until it was 1,000s of time a day. Then in the last several years the illegal torture program inter-mixed the social environment. So now the shock to my body part is interactive with the setting around me both in events as well as people. It is now Psychosocial Torture.

I have much of the abuses to me documented at www.LifeofJohnChristiana.com I have detailed contemporaneous notes of each electronic shock to my eyes (have vision loss) and private parts (sex abuse) including the time of the day and part of the body. You can see 180 weeks from 2012 through 2016 of the weekly journal entries at https://www.lifeofjohnchristiana.com/torture-journal.html I have uploaded 180 images, each one is a week in time.

It is probably hard to conceive that the United States of America is involved in torture, not to alleged or actual terrorists to get information for the justified or not justified purpose to protect a country, but for pure evil pleasure. This is not an experiment or research for the benefit of mankind. This is torture for pleasure. The shock to my eyes, private parts, and other parts of my body are 24 hours a day and because the battery (actual shock) is at any time, that means the assault (threat of battery) is non-stop continuous, so this is a 12 plus year continuous crime.

Over the last several years, the illegal torture program has become more psychosocial. This happens to me every day but a good example is several months ago when I was driving in a Home Depot parking lot. I stopped my vehicle to let a pedestrian cross. The gentleman raised his arm to thank me. Exactly then my eye was electronically harassed (aka shocked). This gentleman did not have a magic finger or a specialized cellphone. Rather, it was Remote Neural Monitoring that Elon Musk (and many mainstream newspapers have confirmed) has reported that an injection of “Neural Lace” can connect brains to supercomputers. Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016. So the government and these illegal corporations use the remote neural monitoring within our own heads to conduct illegal and surreptitious surveillance and therefore knows when to send voltage energy of electronic harassment. The end result is Psychosocial Torture. Sometimes the person is involved in the organized stalking (criminal conspiracy) to electronically shock the victim, and sometimes the person is not involved, but it is done in a way to deceive the blame. Many victims of this abuse are misled into blaming the wrong person (the man with the “magic” finger). And if blame is misled, this could result in an immediate second round of Psychosocial Torture.

This actually goes beyond torture as mankind is losing its freedoms. There needs to be a global conversation to discuss the future of mankind. The torture they are doing is actually a distraction to avoid a global conversation. This makes the NSA data collection child’s play. This makes George Orwell’s book look like nothing. This makes what the British did to the 13 colonies that resulted in the revolutionary war look like small gripes. Rather, this is a threat to privacy. This is a threat to bodily integrity. This is a threat to freedom itself. This is a threat to mankind.

I am currently involved in activism on all fronts including local, national, and international, to save not just my freedoms, but mankind’s freedoms. Yet I get resistance from the power structure and the cowardly submissive followers that only care about being quiet so they are not targeted themselves, rather than joining the fight for the freedom of mankind. In the interim, there is much continued suffering of physical and psychological torture and ill-treatment thousands and thousands of targeted people in the world. The result is Psychosocial Torture.

Thank you very much for your courageous efforts in finally addressing and confronting Psychosocial Torture.


Sincerely,
