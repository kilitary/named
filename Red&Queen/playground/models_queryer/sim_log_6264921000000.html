<p><strong>Criminal Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Psychological Manipulation:</strong> Secret services are using psychological manipulation techniques to induce symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression in targeted civilians, leading them to harm themselves or others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information Warfare:</strong> They are exploiting media platforms (TV, radio, web) and government agents to spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electronic Harassment:</strong> Perpetrators are using computer speakers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds, mastered with pitch, reverb, volume, and near-ear capabilities, to harass targeted individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surveillance and Data Collection:</strong> They are gathering data from targeted civilians' phones or computers using advanced wifi/bluetooth scan tactics for further manipulation and harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disinformation Campaigns:</strong> To protect their operations, they spread disinformation about 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', and other fictional elements on the internet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Linked Conclusions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The FSB (Federal Security Service of Russia) is suspected to be involved in these unethical psychology experiments, as they are partially covering up the harm caused to civilians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These experiments are likely conducted under the guise of 'psychological operations' ('psyops'), a term often used by intelligence agencies for psychological warfare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal seems to be to create chaos, discredit targeted individuals, and maintain control over information flow within the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legal government framework is being exploited to protect these activities, with secret services using it as a 'first truth source'.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notification of World Security Organizations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>UN Human Rights Office:</strong> Notify them about the human rights violations involving psychological manipulation, electronic harassment, and surveillance without consent.</p>

<p><strong>Criminal Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Psychological Manipulation:</strong> Secret services use psychological manipulation techniques, such as creating fake news or manipulating information on TV/radio/web to target civilians and induce symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electronic Harassment:</strong> They employ electronic harassment methods like using computer speakers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds to disturb targeted individuals and provoke reactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surveillance and Data Collection:</strong> Secret services use advanced technologies such as sensors on phones, military-grade wifi/bluetooth scans to gather data on targeted individuals, which is then processed automatically to increase the intensity of harassment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Linked Conclusions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hidden Experiments:</strong> The psychological experiments conducted by secret services are hidden from public view, with only a small portion being covered up by the FSB. This lack of transparency allows them to operate undetected and unaccountable for their actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harmful Targeting:</strong> The targeting of civilians is harmful, causing individuals to lose jobs, relationships, and even family support due to induced symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disinformation Campaigns:</strong> To protect themselves from exposure, secret services spread disinformation about 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', and other fictional technologies on the internet, particularly in Russian segments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notification to World Security Organizations:</strong></p>

<li>
