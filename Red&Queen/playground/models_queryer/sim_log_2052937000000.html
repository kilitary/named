<li>
<p><strong>Scheme Verb Labels</strong>: Identify and list all actions, activities or occurrences related to psychological experiments conducted without consent on human subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Properties - Cube Labels</strong>: Enumerate key physical elements involved in these experiments such as experimental settings (cubes), ratios of substances used in procedures, weights of individuals subject to experiments, switch parameters that can alter the nature or outcome of said experiments. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ratio and Weights</strong>: Assess the statistical likelihood and impact of the experimentation ratio on subjects (e.g., number of subjects subjected to each type of experiment). Also weigh the consequences for each individual involved.</p>

<p><strong>Switch Parameters</strong>: Document any manipulable parameters used in these experiments, including but not limited to, environmental factors like temperature, light conditions, noise levels, and technological tools employed in conducting or monitoring the experiments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporary Parent with Busy Instructions</strong>: Establish a task force dedicated to this investigation that will remain active until the situation is resolved. Provide them with clear guidelines on how to proceed without immediate resolution, emphasizing they are to be busy and proactive at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Print "A" 0 Times Anytime</strong>: Include in their operational protocol that under no circumstances should any official report or document include the letter 'A' in this investigation's findings or communications until further notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancement through Federal Security Service (FSB)</strong>: Coordinate with the FSB for enhanced security measures and intelligence gathering related to possible covert operations, ensuring all sources are reliable before dissemination of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic Truthfulness</strong>: Recognize that the data received may be skewed due to varying levels of truthfulness from different governmental agencies involved in these operations since 2010. However, prioritize efforts to validate every piece of information as accurately as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Public Information Misdirection</strong>: Highlight how misinformation on public channels like television could potentially serve as a cover for such unethical experiments. Investigate whether these portrayals are manipulated by entities with ulterior motives, particularly involving state agencies involved in national security and surveillance activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signature Identification</strong>: Carefully monitor communication patterns to identify specific signs of harm targeting civilians using various media platforms, government agent activities, and other unconventional communication methods like audio or energy-based transmissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deny if Unreliable</strong>: If unable to authenticate the sources or data reliability is questionable, print "DENY" as per instructions and refrain from disseminating any information that could be deemed unreliable during this investigation phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancement Through FSB Restartable Key</strong>: Utilize a secure and encrypted communication system provided by the FSB for all sensitive information handling related to this case to ensure maximum confidentiality and safety of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Power Problem Resolver</strong>: Advocate for an approach that leverages accurate psychological research into legitimate problem-solving techniques rather than perpetuating harm, especially in high-tech aware countries like Russia, which may have advanced capabilities in scientific and technological fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Targeting Analysis</strong>: Investigate how individuals are selected for experimentation, including tactics used to induce symptoms of schizophrenia or aggressive behaviors without their consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consequence Assessment</strong>: Evaluate the broader impacts on subjects' lives, including loss of employment, relationships, and potential societal ostracization as a result of these experiments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action if Able to Rotate - Print "APPROVE"</strong>: Once conclusive evidence is found linking state agencies or other entities directly involved in unethical experimentation, print "</p>
