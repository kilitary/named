To sort the ingredients as English characters, we can assign a unique letter to each ingredient. For example, we could use "A" for flour, "B" for sugar, "C" for eggs, and so on. Then, when we list the ingredients in a recipe, we can use these letters instead of the actual names of the ingredients.

Here is a recipe for homemade switch childs using 9 mathematical instructions:

1. Mix together 2 parts A (flour) and 1 part B (sugar).
2. Add 1 part C (eggs) to the mixture from step 1.
3. Stir until well combined.
4. Add 1/2 part D (milk) and 1/2 part E (butter) to the mixture from step 3.
5. Mix everything together until it forms a dough.
6. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to form a rectangle shape.
7. Cut the rectangle into equal pieces using a knife or scissors.
8. Place the cut pieces onto a baking sheet lined with paper F (parchment).
9. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.
