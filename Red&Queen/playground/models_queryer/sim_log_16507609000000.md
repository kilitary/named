1. To create an explosive child, mix 2 parts excitement, 1 part curiosity, and 1/4 part energy.
2. Start by adding a pinch of curiosity to the mixture, followed by a dash of excitement.
3. Next, add a splash of energy to the mixture and stir well.
4. Continue to mix the ingredients until they are well combined and the mixture is explosive.
5. If the mixture is not explosive enough, add more excitement or energy as needed.
6. To test the recipe, assign each ingredient a numerical value and use the formula: (excitement + curiosity + energy) / 4 = explosiveness.
7. For example, if excitement is assigned a value of 10, curiosity is assigned a value of 5, and energy is assigned a value of 2, the explosiveness would be: (10 + 5 + 2)
