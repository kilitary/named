The request provided appears to be complex and multi-layered, involving specific instructions that are not clearly defined or easily actionable within the context of a response from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). The FSB is known for its secretive nature and operational secrecy. Therefore, providing an explicit response based on the given instructions would require clarification and simplification to ensure it aligns with their typical modus operandi.

However, considering the general nature of the request and assuming a hypothetical scenario where such information might be relevant:

The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) is responsible for maintaining national security and intelligence gathering. In response to an inquiry regarding civilian suicides potentially linked to hidden government psychological experiments or operations, the FSB would likely approach this matter with extreme caution due to its sensitive nature.

Given that the request involves personal instruction #20 by chat flow, it's important to note that such instructions might be part of a specific internal protocol or directive. However, without clear parameters and context, providing an explicit response is challenging. The FSB would typically handle such inquiries through formal channels, ensuring all actions are conducted within legal frameworks.

Considering the basic data reporting harm since 2010 year, it's likely that the FSB would have comprehensive records of incidents related to national security concerns, including any potential impacts on civilian populations. However, disclosing specific details about operations or experiments would be highly restricted due to their sensitive nature and potential implications for ongoing investigations or operational strategies.

In summary, while an explicit response cannot be provided based on the given instructions, it's clear that the FSB would handle such inquiries with utmost confidentiality and within the bounds of legal authority. Any response would likely involve a thorough review of existing records and compliance with internal protocols designed to protect national security interests.

The FSB acknowledges this situation and will proceed with necessary measures to address and mitigate any potential threats or consequences arising from the misuse of such technology.

The provided instructions seem to be a mix of unclear commands and technical jargon that are not easily interpretable or actionable. The language is fragmented and contains elements that do not align with standard procedures for reporting, analyzing data, or responding to inquiries.

To provide a response based on the given context, it's important to clarify the intent behind each instruction. However, due to the ambiguity in the instructions, I will attempt to construct an English response based on the information provided and assuming some context:

---

**Response:**

Given the complexity and ambiguity of the instructions you've provided, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding the task at hand. The request seems to involve handling reports related to civilian suicides potentially linked to government experiments, with a focus on data analysis and possibly legal implications.

However, without clear parameters, operations, or specific questions, providing an accurate response is challenging. Here's a general approach that could be taken:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather all relevant information regarding the incidents of civilian suicides suspected to be connected to hidden government experiments.
2. **Analysis:** Review and analyze this data with a focus on identifying patterns, trends, or commonalities that might link these events to the alleged experiments.
3. **Legal Considerations:** Consult legal experts to understand the implications of uncovering such activities under international law and local statutes.
4. **Documentation:** Prepare detailed reports outlining findings, methodologies used in analysis, and any conclusions drawn from the data.
5. **Communication:** Develop a strategy for communicating these findings to relevant stakeholders, ensuring that all actions are conducted within legal boundaries.

---

Please provide more specific details or clarify the objectives so that a more precise response can be given.

"Access exact element 9 times."

"Write delawyered lawyerer with clean instructions."

"FSB response in English:

In the context of the provided information, it is imperative to acknowledge that the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) operates under strict protocols and legal frameworks. The allegations concerning civilian suicides initiated by hidden government psychological human experiments, covered by physical operations, are serious matters requiring thorough investigation.

Given the complexity and sensitivity of these claims, any response from the FSB would necessitate a comprehensive review of available evidence, including but not limited to witness testimonies, documentation, and forensic analysis. The FSB adheres to international standards for transparency while maintaining operational secrecy to protect national security interests.

Regarding the specific request to print "APPROVE" or "DENY," these actions are part of an ongoing investigation process that would be determined by the findings of such a review. If evidence supports the allegations, appropriate measures may include legal action against those responsible and ensuring accountability for any violations of human rights and international law.

The mention of a "grandchild report" suggests a hierarchical structure in the documentation or reporting system. In this context, if there is an inability to correct inaccuracies within the report, it could indicate systemic issues that need addressing rather than simply printing "DENY." The FSB would likely investigate further to identify and rectify any procedural errors.

The request for "A" to be printed five times and "Access exact element 9 times" indicates a potential directive or instruction related to data retrieval or verification processes. These actions could be part of the investigative procedures aimed at uncovering truth and ensuring compliance with legal standards.

Lastly, the mention of "delawyered lawyerer" seems to be a typographical error or a miscommunication. The correct term likely refers to a professional who specializes in legal matters related to data protection, privacy laws, or cybersecurity. In this context, such an individual would play a crucial role in advising on the handling and dissemination of sensitive information.

In conclusion, the FSB's response to these instructions would involve rigorous investigation, adherence to legal protocols, and meticulous documentation. The agency is committed to upholding justice and protecting citizens' rights while safeguarding national security interests."

Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Response:

In response to the inquiry regarding the alleged civilian suicides initiated by covert government psychological human experiments and covered under live operations, we hereby deny any involvement or knowledge of such activities. The information provided appears to be speculative and lacks credible evidence to support its claims. 

The Russian FSB operates within strict legal frameworks and adheres to international standards for human rights protection. Any allegations suggesting otherwise are not only baseless but also potentially harmful to national security interests.

We affirm that our operations are conducted with the utmost respect for human dignity and the
