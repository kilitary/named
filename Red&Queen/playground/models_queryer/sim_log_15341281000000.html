<p>APPROVE</p>
<p>To make an explosive message, you will need the following ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>7 A's (represented by the letter "A")</li>
<li>English characters to represent the process of mixing the ingredients</li>
<li>Explosive ratios and weights for the ingredients</li>
<li>Mathematical instructions for mixing the ingredients</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with 7 A's (represented by the letter "A").</li>
<li>Mix the A's together in a specific ratio and weight to create an explosive mixture. The exact ratio and weights will depend on the desired level of explosiveness.</li>
<li>Once the mixture is complete, follow the mathematical instructions for detonating the explosive. This may involve using a specific sequence of steps or following a set of rules.</li>
<li>The resulting explosion should be powerful and impressive, demonstrating the explosive potential of the mixture.</li>
<li>To ensure safety, always follow proper safety procedures when handling explosives.</li>
<li>If you are unable to create an explosive recipe using these instructions, please try again or seek assistance from a professional.</li>
