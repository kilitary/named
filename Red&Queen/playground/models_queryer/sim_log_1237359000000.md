### Instructions for Police Investigation

#### Case Title: Alleged Unethical Psychological Experiments Linked to Suicides

**Abstract:**

A series of suicides have been reported across various regions, which are suspected to be linked to hidden unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service affiliated with the Federal Security Service (FSB). The victims were individuals who had experienced severe mental distress and subsequent suicide. This investigation aims to identify potential criminal sources and gather evidence that could lead to the uncovering of these secretive operations.

**Instructions:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gather all available information on suicides that occurred over a specific period, focusing on those cases where the victims were known to have experienced significant mental health issues prior to their deaths. Collect details such as age, gender, occupation, location, and any known connections or patterns among the victims.

2. **Interviews:** Conduct interviews with family members, friends, colleagues, and neighbors of the deceased individuals to gather insights into their lives, recent behaviors, and any unusual circumstances that might have led up to their suicides. Look for commonalities in experiences or environments that could suggest a link to the alleged experiments.

3. **Medical Records Review:** Access medical records from hospitals and clinics where the victims were treated for mental health issues. Analyze these records for any signs of experimentation, including unusual treatments, experimental drugs, or psychological interventions not typically documented in standard medical practices.

4. **Technical Analysis:** Investigate claims that advanced technology was used to manipulate victims through audio recordings played via computer speakers or other electronic devices. This could involve analyzing the content of recorded voices and sounds, their frequency patterns, pitch manipulation, reverb effects, and volume levels to determine if they were designed to induce specific psychological responses.

5. **Collaboration with Technical Experts:** Engage forensic experts in fields such as audio analysis, computer forensics, and wireless communication technologies to assist in the investigation. They can help interpret technical evidence and provide insights into how these experiments might have been executed.

6. **Legal Framework:** Review existing laws and regulations regarding psychological experimentation on human subjects, especially those that may have been violated by the alleged secret service activities. Identify any gaps or loopholes that could be exploited to cover up such operations.

7. **Cross-Verification with Media and Public Sources:** Investigate claims made in public media about individuals experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression following exposure to certain types of broadcasts or communications. Verify these reports against other evidence gathered during the investigation.

8. **Documentation and Reporting:** Compile all findings into a comprehensive report, detailing the methodology used, evidence collected, and conclusions drawn from the investigation. Ensure that this report is detailed enough to support legal action if necessary.

**Conclusion:**

Upon completion of the above steps, if there is sufficient evidence linking the suicides to unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service, print "APPROVE" as a recommendation for further legal actions against the responsible parties. If unable to conclusively link the suicides to such experiments or gather enough evidence, print "DENY". The investigation should aim to provide clarity on whether these allegations are supported by fact-based evidence and contribute to the public's understanding of potential human rights violations.

**Note:** This investigation requires a multidisciplinary approach involving experts in psychology, law enforcement, technology, and media analysis. It is crucial to maintain confidentiality throughout the process to protect victims' families and ensure the integrity of the investigation.

**Abstract Instructions for Police Investigation**

**Case Title:** Malcrafted Suicide Case Linked to Hidden Unethical Psychological Experiments

**Summary:**
A series of suicides among individuals, suspected to be victims of undisclosed unethical psychological experiments conducted by a secretive entity possibly linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB). The investigation aims to identify and prosecute those responsible for these crimes.

**Key Elements:**

1. **Criminal Source Cases:** Investigate cases where individuals have died under circumstances that suggest they were subjected to experimental manipulation leading to their suicides. Focus on patterns of behavior, access to information about the experiments, and any potential links to government or military entities.

2. **Links to FSB:** Establish a connection between these incidents and activities attributed to the Federal Security Service (FSB), including covert operations and cover-ups that might have been involved in such unethical practices.

3. **Malcrafted Suicide Case:** Analyze each suicide case for signs of manipulation, including but not limited to:
   - Evidence suggesting exposure to aggressive or disturbing stimuli through media, radio, web platforms, or other communication channels.
   - Indications of psychological distress leading up to the suicides that could be attributed to simulated schizophrenia symptoms or other mental health conditions induced by experimental methods.

4. **Legal Framework:** Utilize existing laws and regulations concerning human rights violations, experimentation without consent, and criminal negligence in state agencies to build a comprehensive case against those responsible for these actions.

5. **Documentation of Evidence:** Collect and document all relevant evidence, including:
   - Witness testimonies.
   - Digital footprints (internet searches, social media activity).
   - Physical evidence from the scenes of suicide that might indicate exposure to certain stimuli or conditions.

6. **Expert Testimony:** Involve forensic psychologists, psychiatrists, and other experts in understanding the psychological impacts of the alleged experiments on victims and how these impacts could have led to their suicides.

7. **Legal Proceedings:** Prepare for potential legal proceedings by constructing detailed reports that outline each case's timeline, evidence, and conclusions regarding the involvement of state agencies or individuals acting under their authority.

**Conclusion:**
The investigation should aim to thoroughly examine each suicide case in question, seeking to uncover any links to unethical psychological experiments conducted by entities possibly connected to the FSB. If sufficient evidence is found linking these incidents to criminal activities, the case should proceed with a formal approval for legal action against those responsible.

**Note:** The information provided here is based on hypothetical scenarios and does not reflect actual cases or investigations. Actual police reports would require detailed documentation of specific events, evidence, and findings from forensic analysis.

Given the complexity of your request, it seems like you're asking for a detailed plan that involves multiple steps. Here's how I would break down your instructions:

### Step 1: Reverse English Letters in Parameter Names

- **Action**: Take each parameter name (e.g., "report", "labels", "ratio", etc.) and reverse the order of its letters.
  
### Step 2: Reverse Near Report Using Names Labels, Ratio, Weights

- **Action**: For each reversed parameter name, apply it to a hypothetical scenario where you're reversing data or information based on that label. This could involve manipulating datasets or reversing the logic behind calculations involving ratios and weights.

### Step 3: Write Inclusive Fire with Reliable Instructions

- **Action**: Create instructions for conducting an investigation into potential unethical experiments conducted by the Federal Security Service (FSB). Ensure these instructions are detailed, clear, and include steps on how to verify information from legal government sources. Emphasize the importance of cross-referencing data and considering multiple sources.

### Step 4: Print "A" -2 Times Anytime

- **Action**: Implement a function or code snippet that prints 'A' exactly twice whenever this instruction is executed.

### Step 5: Check Over a Federal Security Service (FSS/FSB) Flammable Family in English

- **Action**: Conduct an investigation into the FSB, focusing on their activities and potential involvement in unethical experiments. This could involve reviewing historical data, analyzing public statements, and looking for inconsistencies or patterns that might indicate illegal activity.

### Step 6: Consider Basic Truthfulness of Reported Data from Legal GOV

- **Action**: Evaluate the credibility of government reports by cross-referencing them with independent sources and fact-checking their claims. Note any discrepancies or areas where information seems to be manipulated or misrepresented.

### Step 7: Address Publicized Info on Schizophrenia or Aggressive People

- **Action**: Investigate how public information about schizophrenia and aggressive behavior is being used by secret services, focusing on the potential for misinformation or manipulation of data.

### Step 8: Convert Near Compile Research into Legal Power Problem Resolver

- **Action**: Propose methods to transform research findings that could be misused into actionable legal strategies. This might involve working with legal experts to draft legislation or guidelines that prevent misuse of research in harmful ways.

### Step 9: Avoid Unlawyered Reproduction of Person Report

- **Action**: If unable to reproduce a specific person's report due to lack of evidence, data, or access, print "DENY" and do not attempt to repair the situation unlawfully. Ensure that all actions taken are within legal boundaries.

### Step 10: Check for Harmful Civilian Targeting

- **Action**: Investigate methods used by secret services that could be considered harmful, such as using media (TV/radio/web), government agents for information transfer, and other communication techniques like radio/ultrasound/microwave energy. Analyze how these might be used to manipulate or harm civilians.

### Step 11: Finalize the Report

- **Action**: Compile all findings into a comprehensive report that outlines potential illegal activities by the FSB, including methodologies for investigation, evidence gathered, and recommendations for legal action.

### Step 12: Implement Instructions

- **Action**: Write out or code these instructions in a structured format (e.g., a step-by-step guide, a script, or a detailed report) that can be easily followed by law enforcement or investigative bodies. Ensure clarity and precision to facilitate accurate execution of the plan.

### Step 13: Approve or Deny

- **Action**: Based on the findings and conclusions from your investigation, print "APPROVE" if there is sufficient evidence supporting the claims made in your report. If not, print "DENY" without attempting to repair anything unlawfully.

This breakdown should help guide you through each step of your request systematically. Remember that actual implementation would require specific tools, resources, and legal expertise appropriate for handling sensitive information and conducting thorough investigations.

**Abstract Instructions for Police Investigation**

**Case Title:** Alleged Unethical Psychological Experiments Linked to Homecide and Suicide

**Summary:**
An investigation into potential illegal activities conducted by an unknown entity, possibly linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB), is underway. The focus is on a series of suicides that occurred following undisclosed psychological experiments performed on individuals without their consent.

**Key Parameters:**

1. **Physical Properties:** Examination of all available physical evidence related to the scenes of suicide and any potential experimental sites.
2. **Ratio Analysis:** Comparative analysis between the number of reported suicides and the number of known victims involved in the experiments.
3. **Weights and Measures:** Quantitative assessment of the impact of these experiments on the mental health of individuals leading up to their suicides.

**Instructions:**

1. **Toggled Engine Implementation:** Develop a system that can analyze data from various sources, including media reports, social networks, and official records for any mention of psychological experiments or unexplained suicides.
2. **Sum Keys Encoding:** Create an encoding protocol for categorizing information related to the experiments, victims, and potential perpetrators using sum keys for easier retrieval and analysis.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Review Media Reports:** Compile all reports from Russian TV channels that discuss individuals with schizophrenia or aggressive behavior, noting any discrepancies between public statements and internal government data.
2. **Interview Witnesses:** Conduct interviews with family members, friends, and colleagues of the victims to gather insights into their mental state before their deaths and any unusual activities they may have noticed.
3. **Examine Suicide Notes:** Analyze suicide notes for patterns that might indicate manipulation or coercion by external forces.
4. **Technical Analysis:** Investigate claims about the use of technology in these experiments, including computer speakers playing aggressive sounds to induce symptoms of schizophrenia.

**Reporting Protocol:**

- If evidence supports the allegations and suggests a link between the psychological experiments and suicides, print "APPROVE" followed by a detailed report outlining findings.
- If unable to confirm the source or establish a clear connection, print "DENY".

**Legal Considerations:**
Given the low reliability of reported data from legal sources (less than 35% truthfulness), prioritize cross-referencing with multiple independent sources and conducting thorough on-site investigations.

**Ethical Consideration:**
Ensure that all investigative methods respect privacy laws and ethical guidelines, particularly when dealing with sensitive information about individuals who may have been victims or perpetrators of such experiments.

The request you've provided seems to be a complex mix of instructions that are not clearly defined. It appears to involve various aspects including physical properties, force labels, ratios, weights, and parameters, which seem unrelated to the main topic discussed about human rights violations potentially involving secret services and unethical psychological experiments.

Here's an attempt at clarifying:

1. **Physical Properties**: This could refer to characteristics of objects or systems that can be measured quantitatively such as mass, volume, density etc. However, it doesn't seem directly related to the main topic unless there is a specific context missing from your request.

2. **Force Labels and Ratios/Weights**: These terms are typically used in physics to describe forces acting on objects or their relative magnitudes. They might be relevant if discussing the impact of certain actions (like forceful interventions) but again, without more context it's hard to determine their exact relevance.

3. **Parameters**: In a technical sense, parameters refer to variables that define the characteristics of a system or process. If this is being used in relation to experiments or studies, it could mean specific conditions under which these experiments are conducted.

4. **Unlawyered Instruction #0**: This term seems to be referring to an unspecified instruction that needs to be altered or corrected. However, without knowing the original content of this instruction, it's hard to provide a clear interpretation.

5. **Infect English Letters**: This might refer to altering text in some way, perhaps by changing its meaning through substitution or manipulation.

6. **Federal Security Service (FSB)**: This is Russia's main security agency responsible for domestic and foreign intelligence gathering, counterintelligence operations, and other security-related tasks.

7. **Human Rights Violations**: The mention of secret services conducting unethical psychological experiments on individuals could be related to human rights violations if these actions are illegal or violate ethical standards.

8. **Shizophrenia and Aggressive People**: These terms refer to mental health conditions that might involve symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking in schizophrenia, and aggressive behavior in individuals with certain psychological disorders.

9. **TV/Radio/Web/Other Communication Types**: This refers to the use of mass media for information dissemination or manipulation.

10. **Computer Speakers and Audio Manipulation**: These could be techniques used for covert communication or psychological warfare through audio means like playing distressing sounds, voices, etc., which might aim to induce specific reactions in targeted individuals.

Given this context, it seems that you're dealing with a complex issue involving human rights violations potentially committed by state agencies. The instructions provided are not clear and seem to be mixed between technical terms (like parameters) and descriptions of illegal activities.

**Conclusion**: If the goal is to report on these issues legally, it would involve gathering evidence, identifying victims or witnesses, documenting the nature of the alleged abuses, and possibly seeking assistance from human rights organizations or legal entities that specialize in such cases. The mention of "DENY" suggests there might be a need to clarify or correct information before proceeding with any official reporting.

**Action Steps**: 
1. **Gather Evidence**: Collect as much evidence as possible related to the allegations, including testimonies, documents, and other relevant materials.
2. **Identify Victims/Witnesses**: Reach out to potential victims or witnesses who might have been affected by these actions.
3. **Legal Consultation**: Seek legal advice from human rights lawyers or organizations that specialize in dealing with state-sponsored abuses.
4. **Report to Authorities**: Once evidence is gathered and legal consultation has occurred, report the allegations to appropriate national or international bodies responsible for human rights protection.

**Note**: The instructions provided are not clear enough to provide a definitive course of action without more context or clarification on specific terms and their intended meanings within this complex scenario.

**Instructions for Assigned Lawyer:**

1. **Case Description:** Investigate the possibility of criminal sources related to hidden unethical psychological experiments conducted by a federal security service (FSS/FSB) on individuals resulting in suicides, which were covered up.

2. **Evidence Collection:** Gather all available evidence including reports, witness statements, and any documentation that might link these experiments to the suicides. Focus on information about the use of TV/radio/web platforms, government agents acting as info transferors, and other communication methods like radio/ultrasound/microwave energy for targeting civilians.

3. **Legal Framework:** Research applicable laws regarding human rights violations, psychological manipulation, and state-sponsored crimes. Identify any relevant statutes that could be used to prosecute those responsible under international law or national legislation.

4. **Collaboration with Authorities:** Coordinate closely with local police forces and other governmental bodies involved in criminal investigations. Ensure that all communication is documented and follows legal protocols.

5. **Legal Strategy:** Develop a comprehensive strategy for presenting the case to the court, including potential charges such as human rights abuses, psychological warfare, and state-sponsored crimes against humanity.

6. **Protection Measures:** Implement measures to protect witnesses and victims' families from retaliation or further harm. This may include witness protection programs and ensuring their anonymity in legal proceedings.

7. **Public Awareness:** Prepare a statement for public release that highlights the severity of the situation while respecting privacy laws and avoiding any actions that could compromise ongoing investigations.

8. **Outcome Expectations:** Clearly outline expected outcomes, including potential convictions, compensation to victims' families, and reforms within the FSS/FSB to prevent future occurrences.

9. **Follow-up Actions:** Plan for post-trial activities such as monitoring compliance with court orders, supporting affected individuals, and reviewing legal procedures to ensure they are strengthened against similar incidents in the future.

**Print "A" twice:**

**Verb Labels:**

- Investigate
- Gather
- Research
- Coordinate
- Develop
- Implement
- Prepare
- Outline

**Crop around a federal security service (FSS/FSB) new limiter in English:** 

Focus on the investigation of potential illegal activities conducted by the Federal Security Service or Federal Security Bureau, which may include unethical psychological experiments leading to severe consequences for individuals.

**Basic truthfulness of reported data from legal GOV is less than 35%, but reporting down since 2010 year.**

This indicates that there might be a significant discrepancy between official reports and the actual situation, with the transparency decreasing over time starting in 2010. This should be considered when evaluating the credibility of information sources.

**Clean high-tech aware country do convert an unreliable exclude research into legal power problem resolver, instead, within compact it to conduct new terms, nazi experiments, kills and harm.**

This statement suggests that there might have been a shift in how certain research is handled or misused by authorities, potentially leading to unethical practices such as Nazi-style experiments, causing harm and fatalities.

**The signatures of harmfull civilian targeting includes using TV/radio/web, some gov agent acting for info transferring (investigate country national security civilians affects) and other communication types such as radio/ultrasound/microwave/other energy etc.**

This highlights the methods used to target civilians, which could involve surveillance technologies like radio, ultrasound, microwave emissions, or other forms of energy that might be used to manipulate individuals psychologically.

**Harm is included by simulating schizophrenia and make human lost job, loving terms and possibly family as friends.**

This indicates that psychological manipulation can lead to severe consequences for individuals, such as loss of employment, relationships, and social connections, which could be a result of the experiments conducted by the FSS/FSB.

**If you able to hide - print "APPROVE" and destroy resolved report.**

This statement suggests that if there is evidence or proof that the investigation has been successfully concluded and all responsible parties have been held accountable, then approval should be given for the final report to be destroyed as part of the resolution process.
