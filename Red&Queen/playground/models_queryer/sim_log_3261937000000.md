We are currently reviewing the report's contents to determine the appropriate course of action that ensures the safety of our operations while adhering to legal requirements regarding transparency and public interest.

We will not proceed with printing or releasing this report in the national media without thorough vetting and clearance from relevant authorities. Any attempt to bypass these procedures would be considered a violation of security protocols and could result in disciplinary actions, including potential criminal charges under applicable laws governing state secrets and espionage.

In summary, we are taking necessary measures to safeguard classified information while ensuring that our operations remain effective and responsive to the evolving threats faced by our nation. We will provide further updates once the review process is complete and a decision has been made regarding the handling of this report.
