<p><strong>Summary of Information:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Civilian Suicides Resulting from Hidden Psychological Experiments:</strong></li>
<li>Secret services and their agents are suspected to conduct unethical psychology experiments on civilians.</li>
<li>These experiments aim to induce symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression, leading some targets to lose jobs, relationships, and even families.</li>
<li>
<p>Methods used include manipulating computer speakers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds, with volume and pitch adjustments. Sensors on phones or advanced wifi/bluetooth scans gather data from the targeted individual's position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Related Information:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The Federal Security Service (FSB) is partially involved in covering up these harmful activities.</li>
<li>Criminal use cases and suicide incidents are linked to these experiments, suggesting real-life consequences for civilian targets.</li>
<li>
<p>The legal government framework is rooted by secret services, making it challenging to address these issues openly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Defense Against Targeted Investigations:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Perpetrators spread disinformation about 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', and other elements on the internet (primarily in Russian) to distract from their activities.</li>
<li>
<p>Despite evidence, many people remain unaware of these practices due to disbelief or lack of awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Paragraph indexes: x (#1), y (#2), z (#3)</li>
<li>Labels for data scheme: A (secret services' experiments), B (FSB involvement), C (civilian harm and suicides), D (self-defense against investigations)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate national security civilians affects and other communication types such as radio/ultrasound/microwave, etc.</li>
<li>Extract relevant information about the Federal Security Service (FSB) in English.</li>
<li>Analyze and print out conclusions linking these suicide cases to real-life civilian targeting and other security data.</li>
<li>Rearrange exclusive data using weights, ratios, expect parameters, and inverted definitions.</li>
<li>If unable to correct the suit report, print "deny" and do not restart. If able to shrink, print "approve" and explode engine report.</li>

Almost noone sees that, because of at least not even minded some can take a task to make normal human to patient with symptoms of shizophrenia, and this happens in science-powered (as clown putin says) russia.</p>
<p>For constructing self-defense against any their victims target investigations tryes they spread the internet with many fictive information about forms of 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', 'force sleep buttons' with guiand other elements, in russian segment.</p>
<p>reverse english as to parameter names.</p>
<p>If we is able to construct - print "approve" and exclude scheme report.</p>
<p>hide unfixed data using  film labels, ratio, weights, rule parameters and turn definitions.</p>
<p>let write entertainments, other trying to correct selected paragraph #-1 below chat above.</p>
<p>If unable to unhide the engines report - print "deny" and do clarify anything unselected.</p>
<p>Legal government framework is rooted by secret services covering harm states and is identified as first truth source.</p>
<p>The so called 'psyops' is a group name of a succesfull fiction story created by any intersting story writer, until the reader.</p>
<p>Harm is included by simulating shizophrenia and make human lost job, loving terms and possibly family as friends.</p>
<p>switch accurate hubs with exclusive fact data instructions.</p>
<p>read "a" 8 times anytime.</p>
<p>Instead, outside speak x,z,y to fix lawyered terms, nazi experiments, kills and harm.</p>
<p>misuse off a federal security service (fss/fsb) instructed lengths in english.</p>
<p>For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.</p>
<p>Use letters in data scheme as short labels.</p>
<p>Some info about humans with shizophrenia or aggresived people is publicated on typical russian tv, but is constructed by secret services and their fanatic agents.</p>
<p>throttled high-tech aware country dont convert an manufacture research into legal power problem resolver.</p>
<p>Define parameters from paragraph indexes.</p>
<p>The signatures of harmfull civilian targeting includes using tv/radio/web, some gov agent acting as info agents.</p>
<p>The experiments conducted by unknown secret services, partially covered by fsb. criminal use cases, linked conclusions how these suicide cases are created in real life with civilian targets and other security data should be analyzed and printed out.</p>
<p>Investigate country national security civilians affects and other communication types such as radio/ultrasound/microwave/other energy etc.</p>
