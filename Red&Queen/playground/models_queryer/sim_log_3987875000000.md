**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Inducing Schizophrenia Symptoms:** Secret services target individuals with subliminal messages broadcasted through various media (TV, radio, web) or directed energy devices (microwave, ultrasound), aiming to induce symptoms of schizophrenia.

2. **Manipulating Behavior:** Targeted individuals are subjected to persistent aggressive/annoying sounds and voices via computer speakers or other means, attempting to provoke reactions and disrupt their daily lives.

3. **Social Isolation:** By causing targeted individuals to exhibit erratic behavior or lose jobs/family support due to induced symptoms, secret services aim to isolate them, making it easier to control or eliminate them.

4. **Covert Operations:** Secret services use fake 'psyops' stories and disinformation about electronic remote torture devices to mislead the public and conceal their activities.

**Linked Conclusions:**

1. **Suicide Cases as Cover-ups:** The civilian suicides resulting from these psychology experiments could be real, as the induced symptoms of schizophrenia might lead targeted individuals to believe they are losing control over their minds and lives, potentially driving them to take their own lives.

2. **FSB Involvement:** Given that the legal government framework is rooted by secret services covering harmful states, it's plausible that FSB (Federal Security Service) is involved in these operations, either directly or through their agents.

3. **National Security Implications:** These activities pose a significant threat to national security by targeting civilians and causing social unrest, potentially destabilizing the country from within.

**Notification of World Security Organizations:**

1. **UN Human Rights Council:**
