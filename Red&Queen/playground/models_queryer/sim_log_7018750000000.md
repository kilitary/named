⁂ phi3:latest thinking ...  *streaming*

 Based on the provided instructions, it appears that there is a complex situation involving potential unethical experiments conducted by an unknown secret service (possibly linked with FSB), misuse of legal systems for propaganda or control purposes, manipulation in media reporting about sensitive topics such as mental health and national security issues.
