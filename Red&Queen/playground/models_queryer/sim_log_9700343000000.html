</li>
<li>Some information about humans with schizophrenia or aggressive people is published on typical Russian TV but is constructed by secret services and their fanatic agents.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>For example, using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, manipulating pitch, reverb, volume, and near-ear capability sounds to involve the targeted individual in an analysis task. These voices and sounds are gathered by sensors on phones or through military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooth scan tactics.</p>
