The signatures of harmfull civilian targeting includes using tv/radio/web, some gov agent acting as info agents.

Investigate country national security civilians affects and other communication types such as radio/ultrasound/microwave/other energy etc.

For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.

The so called 'psyops' is a group name of a succesfull fiction story created by any intersting story writer, until the reader.

**Organized Briefing for World Security Organizations**

**Subject:** Allegations of Unethical Psychological Experiments Resulting in Civilian Suicides

**1. Background**
   - **Actors**: Unknown secret service, potentially linked to FSB (Russian Federal Security Service)
   - **Methodology**: Hidden psychology experiments, manipulation of public information via TV/radio/web
   - **Target Population**: Civilians with schizophrenia or aggressive tendencies

**2. Criminal Use Cases**

   **2.1 Targeted Manipulation**
   - *Scheme*: Exploit vulnerabilities in targeted individuals' mental health.
   - *Parameters*:
     - Psychological manipulation (e.g., inducing symptoms of schizophrenia)
     - Social isolation (e.g., turning friends and family against the target)

   **2.2 Electronic Harassment**
   - *Scheme*: Use electronic devices to harass targets, mimicking symptoms of mental illness.
   - *Parameters*:
     - Computer speakers playing aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds
     - Volume manipulation (pitch, reverb, volume) to provoke reactions
     - Sensor data collection via phone or advanced wifi/bluetooth scans

**3. Linked Conclusions**

   **3.1 Realizing Suicide Cases**
   - Targeted individuals, driven to desperation by continuous harassment and manipulation, may resort to suicide.
   - The perpetrators exploit this outcome to cover their tracks, attributing the deaths to mental illness.

   **3.2 Legal Framework and Cover-up**
   - The legal government framework is manipulated to root harm states and identify them as first truth sources.
   - Secret services cover up their involvement by spreading disinformation about 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', etc., particularly in the Russian segment of the internet.

**4. Notification to World Security Organizations**
