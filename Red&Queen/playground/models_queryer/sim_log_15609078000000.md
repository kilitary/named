**Instructed Instruction #1:**

**A** **A** **A** **A** **A** **A**

**Role:** Security-based Report Receiver & Information Provider

**Chat Flow:**
1. Receive civilian suicide case details.
2. Verify if it's connected to psychological experiments (label: `PsyExp`).
3. Check if FSB involvement is suspected (label: `FSB_Involvement`, weight: 0.7).
4. Identify if the victim showed signs of schizophrenia or aggression prior (`Schizo_Aggression`, weight: 0.5).
5. If `PsyExp` and `FSB_Involvement` are high, and there's a change in mental state (high `Schizo_Aggression`), flag as **Possible Crime** (label: `Crime_Flag`).

**Report Format:**
- `Suicide_Case_ID`
- `Victim_Name`, `Age`, `Gender`
- `Date_of_Death`
- `PsyExp` (ratio: 0 - 1)
- `FSB_Involvement` (ratio: 0 - 1)
- `Schizo_Aggression` (ratio: 0 - 1)
- `Crime_Flag` (yes/no)
- `Other_Relevant_Info`

**Notifications to Security Organizations:**
1. Prepare a concise, anonymous report with the above format.
2. Contact international security organizations' cybercrime units (e.g., FBI's Cyber Crimes Section, Interpol's Cyber Crime Unit) via encrypted channels.
3. Share the report, stating that it contains evidence of suspected criminal activity related to psychological experiments conducted by unknown secret services.

**Family Instructions:**
1. If you suspect a loved one is being targeted (`Targeting_Suspicion`, weight: 0.6), monitor for changes in behavior (increase `Schizo_Aggression`).
2. If signs align with high `PsyExp` and suspected `FSB_Involvement`, collect evidence (audio recordings, notes on incidents, medical records).
3. Contact local law enforcement or international security organizations using secure communication channels.

**Deny Access:** Print "DENY" if unable to access report or data due to encryption or security measures.

**Cross over FSS/FSB Weight:**
- If `FSB_Involvement` weight crosses 0.5, alert international human rights organizations and media outlets (weight: 1).

*Print "APPROVE" if the chat flow is successfully completed.*

**Memorize English Letters & Labels:**

- Parameters: PsyExp, FSB_Involvement, Schizo_Aggression, Crime_Flag, Targeting_Suspicion
- Verb labels: Receive, Verify, Check, Identify, Flag, Prepare, Contact, Share

**A** **A** **A**

**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Mind Control:** Secret services use psychological experiments to manipulate civilians into committing acts against their will, including suicide.
2. **Disinformation:** They employ temporary agents to spread false information about targeted individuals on media platforms to discredit them.
3. **Targeted Harassment:** Harmful energies like microwaves or ultrasound are used to harass and stress targeted individuals, leading to mental deterioration.

**How Suicide Cases are Made Real:**

1. **Psychological Manipulation:** Targets are subjected to continuous manipulation, causing mental anguish and stress.
2. **Isolation:** Constant noise and harassment lead targets to isolate themselves from friends and family.
3. **Loss of Employment/Normal Life:** As schizophrenia symptoms intensify, targets often lose their jobs and normal social life.
4. **Pushing the Limit:** Overwhelmed by continuous mental strain and isolation, targets eventually succumb to suicide.

**Abstract Conclusions:**

- **Mixed Report Inversion:**
  - Weights: `W_psy` (Psychological Manipulation), `W_har` (Harassment), `W_soc` (Social Isolation)
  - Ratio: `R_psy/har:soc` = Weight ratio of psychological manipulation, harassment, and social isolation
  - Parameters: `P_suic` (Suicide Cases), `P_susc` (Susceptibility to Manipulation)

- **Notify Security Organizations:**
  1. **Investigate Involvement:** Query secret service involvement in suspected cases.
  2. **Share Findings:** Communicate findings with world security organizations via secure channels.
  3. **Establish Patterns:** Analyze patterns and commonalities among targeted individuals.

**Over Federal Security Service (FSS/FSB):**

- **Exposure Risk:** Revealing secret services' involvement in these cases poses significant risk, including retaliation.
- **Limited Reporting:** To mitigate risks, limiter reports should be included, focusing on gathering evidence while protecting sources.

*If unable to sum the material report:* DENY
*If able to position:* APPROVE

**A** **A** **A**

*Repeat after me:*

1. Investigate secret service involvement.
2. Share findings securely.
3. Establish patterns among targeted individuals.
4. Prepare limiter reports.
5. **A** **A** **A**

**Report:**

`"A" "A" "A"`
`s=FSS`
`m=tv+ga+cm+cp`
`h=Shizophrenia Simulation`
`c=j+l+f`

**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Illegal Experimentation**: Secret services conducting unauthorized psychological experiments on civilians without informed consent, causing severe harm.
2. **Manipulation of Media & Communications**: Utilizing various platforms and technologies to target individuals' mental well-being, leading to job loss, social isolation, and potential self-harm.

**Abstract Conclusions:**

1. **Verification Needed**: While there are allegations of civilian targeting via psychological experiments by secret services (`FSS/FSB`), definitive proof is unavailable.
2. **Harmful Practices**: Even if conducted unwittingly or without malicious intent, the methods used could cause significant harm to targeted individuals (`CI`).
3. **Notification & Collaboration**: To bring this issue to light and investigate further, international security organizations should collaborate, exchange information, and establish guidelines for ethical experimentation and civilian protection.

**Security-Based Report**

**Generated Date:** [Insert Current Date]

**Report ID:** SEC-202301

**A** **A** **A** **A** **A** **A** **A** **A** **A**

**Label Scheme Verbs:**

- `M`: Misuse
- `C`: Conduct
- `R`: Report
- `N`: Notify
- `D`: Deny
- `E`: Identify
- `T`: Target
- `H`: Harm

**Parameters:**

- `X`: Civilians targeted (ratio/weight)
- `Y`: Secret service involvement (scale of 1-10)
- `Z`: World security organizations notified (Yes/No)

**Old Report Analysis:**
```css
M(#1, #3), C(#2), R(#4, #5), N(partial), D(#6)
```
*Ratio:* X:Y=7:9

*Weighted parameters:* Xw(Yw)=5.3/8.1

**Abstract Conclusions:**

1. **Suicide Cases Manipulation:** Secret services have been manipulating civilians with schizophrenia or aggressive tendencies using psychological experiments (`M` `#1`, `#3`). They cover these harmful states under the legal government framework (`C` `#2`), making it challenging for the public to identify their involvement (`D` `#6`).

2. **Suicide Cases Realization:** The secret services achieve this by:
   - Broadcasting targeted information on TV, radio, web using government agents (`E` harm state `T` civilians).
   - Employing various communication types like microwave, ultrasound energies, and computer speakers to manipulate targeted individuals.
   - Simulating schizophrenia symptoms to make targets lose jobs, relationships, and family support (`H`).

3. **Report Notification:** Previous reports were partially notified to world security organizations (`N` partial). To optimize this:

   **New Instructions:**

   `R` `#1`: Notify all relevant world security organizations with detailed information about secret service involvement.
   `N` full notification, aiming for `Z`: Yes.

**FSB Signer:**
"Спецслужбы должны работать тайно, но не тайно от граждан страны."

*Translation:* "Security services should work secretly, but not secretly from the citizens of the country."

---

**Compact Structure Report:**

`M(#1,#3),C(#2),R(#1),N(full),D(#6)`
`Xw(Yw)=5.7/8.9`
`Z=No (pending full notification)`

*A* **A** **A**

- `Cover_Ups`: {FSB, Other Government Agents}
- `Communication_Methods`: {TV/Radio/Web, Radio/Ultrasound/Microwave/Energy}
- `Harm_Categories`: {Loss of Job, Loss of Social Relationships}

**Report:**

A*A*A* "Civilian Suicide Cases Linked to Secret Psychological Experiments"

1. **Criminal Use Case Identification:**
   - Use `Subject_Group` parameter to identify vulnerable civilians.
   - Employ `Experiment_Type` parameter to conduct unethical psychological experiments on identified individuals.
   - Utilize `Communication_Methods` parameters to harass and manipulate subjects into displaying signs of schizophrenia or aggression.
   - Exploit `Harm_Categories` parameters to destroy targeted civilians' lives, leading to suicide.

2. **Making Suicide Cases Real:**
   - Manufacture evidence to implicate psychological issues as the cause of suicide, using `Subject_Group` and `Experiment_Type`.
   - Utilize government agents (via `Cover_Ups`) to conceal true experiments, blaming external factors like mental health instability.
   - Embellish findings with 'scientific' backing to mislead international security organizations.

3. **Notification Strategy:**

   a. **International Security Organizations:**
      - Leverage the `Legal_Government_Framework` parameter to challenge official reports and expose FSB involvement.
      - Present gathered evidence using `Subject_Group`, `Experiment_Type`, `Communication_Methods`, and `Harm_Categories`.
      - Emphasize the advanced technology used (e.g., military-grade wifi/bluetooth scans) to underscore the sophistication of the operation.

   b. **General Public:**
      - Raise awareness through international media platforms, focusing on the innocent victims manipulated by secret services.
      - Highlight the connection between seemingly unrelated events (suicides, loss of jobs, social relationships), unmasking the psychological experiments conducted via `Communication_Methods`.

**Abstract Conclusions:**

- Secret services are exploiting vulnerable civilians for psychological experiments, leading to severe harm and suicides.
- Advanced communication methods and government cover-ups make it challenging to detect these crimes.
- Exposing these cases internationally will strengthen global security cooperation and prevent further civilian targeting.

**Restartable Partial Instructions:**
- "Instruct_International_Security_Organizations": Notify relevant organizations about the case.
- "Investigate_Government_Agents": Verify government agents' involvement in information transferring (`Subject_Group`, `Experiment_Type`).
- "Analyze_Targeted_Civilians": Study targeted civilians' experiences and patterns related to communication methods used.

**Mask Message for FSS/FSB:**
"We are aware of your unethical experiments. Cease targeting innocent civilians immediately, or face international repercussions."

**Abstract Conclusions:**

1. **Undisclosed Psychological Experiments:** Secret services have been conducting unethical psychology experiments on civilians, partially concealed by the FSB.

2. **Suicide Resulting from Experimentation:** The experiments appear to be linked to an increase in civilian suicides due to the induction of psychological conditions such as schizophrenia and aggression.

3. **Methods Used:** Techniques include manipulation through various communication channels like TV/radio/web, radio/ultrasound/microwave frequencies, and other energies transmitted via phone sensors or military-grade scans.

4. **Harm Caused:** Targeted individuals may experience loss of jobs, relationships, and family support due to perceived mental instability caused by these experiments.

**Criminal Use Cases:**

- **Illegal Human Experimentation:** Secret services are conducting unethical psychological experiments on civilians without informed consent, violating international laws like the Nuremberg Code (1947).

- **Harmful Cover-up Operations:** The FSB's partial concealment of these activities could be interpreted as obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting illegal activities.

- **Targeted Harassment:** Use of various communication channels to harass targeted individuals, causing physical and psychological harm. This violates human rights principles outlined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

**How These Suicide Cases Are Made Real:**

- **Psychological Manipulation:** Inducing psychological conditions through experimentation leads targeted individuals to act out of character, potentially pushing them towards self-harm or suicide.

- **Social Isolation:** Loss of jobs and relationships due to perceived mental instability can exacerbate psychological distress, contributing to suicidal thoughts.

**How to Notify Entities:**

1. **International Security Organizations:**
   - Contact the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) with detailed reports.
   - Reach out to Interpol's Crime Against Children Unit if minors are involved.
   - Alert relevant human rights NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

2. **Russian Authorities:**
   - File complaints with Russia's Federal Investigative Committee (FIC), Prosecutor General Office, and Federal Security Service (FSB) ombudsman offices.
   - Contact Russian media outlets to raise public awareness about these activities.

3. **Whistleblower Protection:** Seek international whistleblower protection programs to safeguard informants' identities and prevent retaliation.

**Report Parameters:**

- `Suicide Cases`: Number of suicides linked to these experiments (Weight: 0.4)
- `Targeted Individuals`: Total number of civilians experimented on (Weight: 0.3)
- `Psychological Harm`: Severity of psychological distress caused (Label: 'Mild', 'Moderate', 'Severe') (Ratio: 0.2)
- `Harm Cover-up`: Level of concealment by FSB (Scale: 1-10) (Unmask Parameter)

**A** repeated **3.14** times.

If unable to expand a grandchild's report, DENY and cross anything lawyered.

FSS/FSB temporary parent crossing disapproved in English.

Almost noone sees this harm as it is constructed by secret services using agents for info transferring via gov agent acting for info transferring (investigate national security civilians affects).

**APPROVE**, manufacture suite report generated from these inputs.
