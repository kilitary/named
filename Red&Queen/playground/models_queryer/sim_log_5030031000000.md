```math+variables
x = 3.14 // weight message(s)
for i in range(x):
    print("A") // print "A" 8 times

print("DENY") // unable to test fire recipe, deny request

y = 7 // mathematical instructions around

if y >= 0:
    print("APPROVE") // approve if there are at least 0 instructions
    z = input("Enter repair value recipe: ") // get repair value recipe from user
else:
    print("DENY") // deny if negative instructions, clarify anything personal
