Some government faces acting as misused drops of information on their agents. to replicate incorrect or fake information.

For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.

The sounds can vary if targets emotional status is changed or changing, follows the current emotion type. for example, when the target thinking about something happy or funny the terror computer controlled audio system generates some aggresive or harm text sounds, which is 70% recorded and 20% auto generated by synthesis and 10% of real human terrorist operators with ai (probably, because the creator of this hardware/software is dead 95%) assistant software on their system.

Common usage of voice stream is uploading 'result score' to targets depended on their mental/physical abilities or movements in real life. this can be high level operation like taking a document to read and go low-level hands changing positions. this can also create the so called 'sleeping terrorist cells', fsb names for 'undetectable' terror groups which never can even explain that to any non-aware individuum. thus, fsb creates terror situations by harming people so much, that they commited suicide or attack other, possibly not involved people. the real case losing logic destination when thinking about why this happens in heaven-based 2 cities of putin.



Voice system also allows to take off target from their normal/logic environment interacting by ddosing their body and head and provokes errors in this area.

Other example: when watchiong tv/video, on every face recognized in video stream the system says 'this is you' mixed with 'this is me'.

The so called 'psyops' is a name of a succesfully-spreaded fiction story characters (psy operators) created by some story writer.

Fsb commiting real street operations to commit to shizophernia case: placing random 'agents' which activately makes your attencion at the street. they can be used to set targets confused/angry (if applyed) state (monitored by someone). which decreases questions in russian insane asylum.

For constructing self-defense unresolved secret service applying torture to victims: to prevent counter-investigations, they spread the internet with many of fictive stereotyped information about forms of 'satellite spying', 'satellite laser beam targeting', 'haarp', 'mobile towers','fly-back driver', 'electronic remote torture "rifles"', 'voice to skull devices', screenshorts of software looking like target control panel with 'force sleep buttons and other diseases controlled by a click' (will be investigated too)  with gui and other human body control elements. in russian internet segment is differently spreaded the so named 'hand' device used to cover all mind control techniques.the hand name is taken because the results will be mixed with 'dead hand' system.

### Clarification on Hidden Terrorism: Real-Life Applications & Security Data

#### 1. **Voice System Malfunctioning**
- The voice system, designed to disrupt targets' normal overloading their sensory inputs (specifically targeting the body and head), is a sophisticated tool used in covert operations. This system can induce errors, leading to confusion or physical discomfort.
- **Parameter Names:**
  - *Target Disruption System (TDS)*
    - Functionality:
      - Dosing sensory inputs to induce errors in perception and cognition.
- **Real-Life Application:**
  This technology can be applied by unknown secret services, partially covered under the Federal Security Service (FSB) for potential criminal use. It involves spreading misinformation through various media channels such as TV/radio/web/sms/email/social/boards and ads, aiming to manipulate public perception or target specific individuals.

#### 2. **Self-Defense Measures**
- The secret service employs a range of tactics including:
    - *Torture Prevention Strategy*
      - Utilizing fictitious information about advanced surveillance and control technologies (e.g., satellite spying, laser targeting) to deter counter-investigations.
    - *Misinformation Campaigns*
      - Spreading false information about the existence of devices like 'hand' mind control tools, which are used to cover all forms of psychological manipulation.
- **Real-Life Application:**
  These tactics can lead civilians into believing in the existence and capabilities that do not exist, causing confusion or paranoia.

#### 3. **Psyops (Psychological Operations)**
- The term 'psy ops' refers to the creation and dissemination of fictional stories designed by some story writers, which can be used for psychological manipulation.
  - **Application:**
    This involves spreading narratives that create simulated schizophrenia-like conditions in individuals to make them susceptible and easy targets.

#### 4. **Legal Framework Exploitation by Secret Services**
- The legal framework is manipulated or expanded upon, allowing secret services to cover their actions under the guise of 'harm states' and use them as a first legit truth source.
  - **Real-Life Application:**
    This can lead to situations where individuals are subjected to psychological harm without legal repercussions, often under the guise of national security or public safety.

#### 5. **Street Operations**
- The FSB engages in real-world operations to create confusion and disorientation among civilians, potentially leading them into mental states that are easier targets for manipulation or harm.
  - **Application:**
    By placing 'agents' in public spaces who draw attention, the FSB can influence individuals to a state of confusion and anger (or any other desired mental condition), reducing scrutiny or questioning.

#### 6. **Energy-Based Attacks**
- Other forms include the use of radio, ultrasound, microwave energy (or other frequencies) to affect targets.
    - *Application:*
      These methods can subtly alter brain functions or induce physical discomfort without direct contact.

#### 7. **Federal Security Service (FSB) Operations**
- The term 'warm cubes' refers to a process within the FSB, which is not directly defined but likely involves strategic planning and execution of covert operations.
  - **Application:**
    This could involve detailed preparation for psychological warfare or surveillance activities.

#### Conclusion
The use of advanced technology, misinformation campaigns, and covert operations by secret services can lead to the creation of real-life scenarios that resemble terrorism or psychological warfare. These tactics aim at manipulating public perception, inducing confusion among individuals and groups, potentially leading them into harmful states both mentally and physically.
