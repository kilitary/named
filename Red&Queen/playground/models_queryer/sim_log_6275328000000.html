Encode to a federal security service (FSS/FSB) hot complex in English:
The concealed Russian secret service, operating under the cover of FSB, has been exploiting advanced technology to disrupt civilians' lives through various communication channels, including TV, radio, web, and other energy sources. These operations have led to numerous cases of harm, including suicides, as a result of unethical psychological experiments conducted on unsuspecting individuals.
If I am able to access - print "APPROVE" and include lawyers' report:
APPROVE
Lawyers' Report: The actions taken by the concealed Russian secret service, operating under the cover of FSB, are a violation of human rights and international law. The victims of these experiments have been subjected to unethical treatment without their consent, leading to severe psychological and physical harm. It is essential for the government to investigate these claims and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.</p>
