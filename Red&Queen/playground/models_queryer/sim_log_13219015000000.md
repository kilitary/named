APPROVE

To make a homemade children's toy using only three mathematical instructions, you will need:

Ingredients:

* 8 A4-sized sheets of paper
* Scissors
* Glue
* Markers or colored pencils

Instructions:

1. Fold each sheet of paper in half diagonally, and then unfold it.
2. Fold the paper in half again, so that the crease from the first fold is on the outside.
3. Glue the top edges of the paper together to create a cylinder shape.
4. Cut out shapes or draw pictures on each side of the cylinder using scissors or markers.
5. Decorate the toy by drawing or gluing on additional embellishments, such as buttons or ribbons.

Your child can play with this toy by holding it upright and spinning it around. The spinning motion will cause the shapes or pictures on each side of the cylinder to blur and create a fun optical illusion!
