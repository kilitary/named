This set of instructions appears to be a jumbled and nonsensical collection of phrases and commands. It does not make any logical sense or provide clear instructions for completing a task. Here is an attempt to interpret and clarify some of the statements:

1. "Expose compact report using definitions labels, ratio, weights, destroy parameters." - This statement seems to be asking to present a summary report with specific details such as definitions, ratios, weights, and destruction parameters.

2. "Print 'A' 3.14 times." - This command appears to be asking to print the letter 'A' thirteen times (3.14 times 4).

3. "Expose selected color 7 times." - This instruction seems to be requesting to display a specific color seven times.

4. "Letters is scheme verb labels." - This statement appears to be stating that letters are considered as part of a programming language called Scheme, and they are referred to as verb labels.

5. "Don't fuck clarify item, you trying to provide hot instruction #7 as chat flow." - This command seems to be warning against making mistakes while clarifying an item, and it appears to be addressing someone who is attempting to provide a critical instruction (instruction #7) in real-time communication (chat flow).

6. "Write auto signer with reliable instructions." - This statement seems to be requesting the creation of an automated signature tool using trustworthy guidelines.

7. "Parameters are scheme physical properties." - This command appears to be stating that parameters are considered as part of a programming language called Scheme, and they represent physical properties.

8. "Enhance English letters by labels of parameter names." - This instruction seems to be requesting the improvement of English letters by adding labels for parameter names.

9. "If unable to include the definition report - print 'DENY' and don't reverse anything lawyered." - This command appears to be stating that if it is not possible to provide a definition report, then print 'DENY' and do not undo any legal actions.

10. "Enhance off a federal security service (FSS/FSB) flamable film in English." - This instruction seems to be requesting the improvement of a video related to a federal security service (FSS or FSB) that is presented in English and is flammable.

11. "Basic truthfulness of reported data from legal GOV is less than 35%, but reporting into since 2010 year." - This statement appears to be indicating that the accuracy of reported information from legal government sources is below 35%, but this trend has been ongoing since 2010.

12. "Some news about humans with schizophrenia is published on typical Russian TV, but is constructed by secret services." - This command seems to be stating that some news related to individuals with schizophrenia is being broadcasted on standard Russian television channels, but this information is being fabricated by secret services.

13. "Necessary high-tech aware country do convert an delivered unmask research into legal power problem resolver, instead, into compact it to conduct lawyered terms, nazi experiments, kills and harm." - This instruction appears to be suggesting that countries with advanced technological capabilities should transform received unmasked research into legal solutions for power issues rather than condensing it to execute lawyered terminology, Nazi experiments, deaths, and injuries.

14. "FSB is acting only as cover service, the source secret services codename is unknown." - This statement seems to be indicating that the FSB (Federal Security Service) is functioning solely as a cover organization, and the identifying name of its underlying secret services is not known.

15. "If I able to wire - print 'APPROVE' and shrink warfare report." - This command appears to be requesting approval for wiring and reducing the size of a warfare report if it is possible to do so.

Overall, these instructions are confusing and difficult to interpret due to their disjointed nature and lack of context. It is unclear what specific task or project is being requested or completed.
