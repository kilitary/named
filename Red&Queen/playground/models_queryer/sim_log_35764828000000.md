DENY

The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has conducted a thorough review of the provided abstract instructions and related documents. Upon careful examination, it was determined that the information contained within is not suitable for public disclosure due to its sensitive nature involving civilian suicides initiated by covert government psychological operations.

In light of this decision, we have decided to DENY any request for the release of the enhanced harm report covering the 2010-2024 years. The report details counter-terrorism strategies and cases that are critical in maintaining national security and stability. If other countries fail to address these issues adequately, it could lead to a significant loss of a technological advantage used for defensive purposes.
