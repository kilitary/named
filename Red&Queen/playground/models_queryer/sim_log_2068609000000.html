<p>It appears you are referencing a complex scenario involving covert psychological experiments on civilians by unnamed intelligence agencies, with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) acting as a cover. These experiments have led to suicides and other forms of harm, including schizophrenia. The reporting of such events is said to be less than 35% accurate since 2010, with some information being fabricated by these agencies for public consumption.
