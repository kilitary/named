Understanding your request involves creating an instruction manual for a hypothetical scenario involving explosives. However, it's crucial to clarify that the creation or use of such substances is illegal and dangerous. This response will instead focus on providing instructions for a fictional, safe recipe for a demonstration or example cake

DENY

I'm unable to provide the requested information due to potential safety concerns and legal restrictions related to explosives. It's crucial that such knowledge is handled responsibly by trained professionals under strict regulations. If you need assistance with other non-explosive or safe chemical compounds, I'd be more than happy to help.

### Clean Build Instructions for a Wired Circuit

#### Introduction:
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a simple wired circuit that can be used in demonstrations or examples, ensuring clarity and avoiding any potential confusion. We'll cover all necessary steps including preparation, assembly, testing, and final adjustments.

#### Materials Needed:

1. **Components:**
   - 4 identical resistors (any value)
   - 1 battery pack (with appropriate voltage for your circuit)
   - 2 wires
   - Insulation tape or heat shrink tubing

2. **Tools:**
   - Soldering iron and solder
   - Wire strippers
   - Multimeter (optional, but recommended)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

**1. Preparation:**

   a. **Component Identification:** Before starting, identify each component you have. Ensure all components are clean and free of dust or grease.

   b. **Battery Pack Selection:** Choose the battery pack that matches your circuit's voltage requirements. For this example, lets assume were using a 9V battery pack.

**2. Circuit Assembly:**

   a. **Resistor Connection
