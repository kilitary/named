**Step 1: Cook English letters as ingredient names**

I assume this means assigning unique letters (e.g., A-Z) to represent ingredients in the recipe. For simplicity, let's use a single letter for each ingredient. I'll create a list of 8 ingredients with corresponding letters:

A - Aluminum
B - Boron
C -
