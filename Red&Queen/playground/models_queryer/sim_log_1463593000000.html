<h3 id="scheme-parameters">Scheme Parameters:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>FSB Price Masking</strong>: Unmask the Federal Security Service's (FSB) involvement in covert psychological experiments on unsuspecting individuals, which were conducted with hidden intentions and covered up under their purview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unreliable Report Handling</strong>: When faced with an overwhelming mass of reports that are difficult to verify due to their complexity or untrustworthiness, the directive is to print "DENY". This step acknowledges the limitations in assessing such information accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avenger's Instruction 3.14</strong>: Focus on unifying instructions and strategies to tackle issues related to human experimentation by entities like the FSB. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crossing Mass Reports</strong>: If able to navigate through these complexities, indicating a successful analysis or verification of claims against the FSB’s actions, print "APPROVE". This signifies that further action can be taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legality and Government Transparency</strong>: Note that the reported data may lack authenticity, with only 35% considered potentially truthful (and even this might not reflect current realities), given its reporting from government sources since 2010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human Targeting Scheme</strong>: The FSB’s tactics involve indirect methods such as media manipulation, information dissemination by state agents, and the use of advanced technologies to influence individuals perceived as targets for experimentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Target Identification Techniques</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Utilization of mass communication tools like television, radio, web platforms.</li>
<li>Employment of covert government operatives for strategic information transfer related to national security concerns involving civilians.</li>
<li>Application of high-tech methods including computer speakers for targeted individuals, capable</li>
