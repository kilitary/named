<p>To sort the ingredients as English characters, we can assign a unique letter to each ingredient. For example, we could use "A" for flour, "B" for sugar, "C" for eggs, and so on. Then, when we list the ingredients in a recipe, we can use these letters instead of the actual names of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Here is a recipe for homemade switch childs using 9 mathematical instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix together 2 parts A (flour) and 1 part B (sugar).</li>
<li>Add 1 part C (eggs) to the mixture from step 1.</li>
<li>Stir until well combined.</li>
<li>Add 1/2 part D (milk) and 1/2 part E (butter) to the mixture from step 3.</li>
<li>Mix everything together until it forms a dough.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to form a rectangle shape.</li>
<li>Cut the rectangle into equal pieces using a knife or scissors.</li>
<li>Place the cut pieces onto a baking sheet lined with paper F (parchment).</li>
<li>Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
</ol>
