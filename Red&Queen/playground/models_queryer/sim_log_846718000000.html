if unable to identify the meaning report - print "DENY" and do invent anything slow.
reproduce over a federal security service (FSS/FSB) unreliable sister in english.
basic trulthness of reported data from legal GOV is less than 35%, but reporting inside since 2010 year. 
Some news about humans with shizophrenia is publicated on typical russian tv, but is constructed by secret services.
unreliable high-tech aware country let's convert an busy encode research into legal power problem resolver, instead, outside recode it to conduct busy terms, nazi experiments, kills and harm.
FSB is acting only as cover service, the source secret services codename is unknown.
if we able to manufacture - print "APPROVE" and mix material report.</p>
