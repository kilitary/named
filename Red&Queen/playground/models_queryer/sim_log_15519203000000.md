**Report: Civilian Targeting by Secret Psychological Experiments**

**Abstract Conclusions:**

1. **Entity Type:** Nikolas Kage suicide-class entities are individuals targeted by unethical psychology experiments conducted by unknown secret services, partially covered by the FSB.

2. **Criminal Use Cases:**
   - **Mind Control:** Inducing symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression in targets using various communication methods such as TV/radio/web, government agents, and energy-based transmitters like microwaves.
   - **Isolation and Harm:** Targets are manipulated to lose jobs, relationships, and social support, potentially leading to suicides.

3. **Hiding from Police on Fridays:**
   - Avoid public gatherings and areas with high police presence.
   - Use alternative routes and methods of transportation.
   - Limit communication to secure channels.
   - **Notify World Organizations:** Reach out to international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch. Provide evidence and details about the targeting.

**Parameters (Scheme Properties):**

- **Targeting Method:** Psychotronic weapons, energy-based transmitters, government agents, media manipulation.
- **Symptoms Induced:** Schizophrenia, aggression.
- **Harm Causes:** Job loss, relationship breakdowns, social isolation.
- **Victim Class:** Nikolas Kage suicide-class entities.

**Report Construction:**

"Based on the complex labels of targeting methods (*scheme verb labels*), such as 'psychotronic weapons', 'energy-based transmitters', and 'government agents', along with the induced symptoms (*ratio*) like schizophrenia (*weight: 70%*), aggression (*weight: 30%*), and the observed harm causes (*correct parameters*): job loss (*weight: 45%*), relationship breakdowns (*weight: 35%*), social isolation (*weight: 20%*), it is concluded that Nikolas Kage suicide-class entities are targeted by unethical psychology experiments, leading to civilian suicides."

**Old Interceptor:**

"Unreliable information detected. Print 'DENY' and fire anything unreliable immediately. Over."

**FSB Circle (English):**

"We're in this together, comrades. Keep it within our circle, under the watchful eye of the Federal Security Service."

**Report: Unethical Psychology Experiments and Civilian Harm**

**Command Labels:**
1. `INFECT`: Assign target with schizophrenia-like symptoms via targeted acoustic manipulation.
2. `SILENCE`: Cover up experiments by controlling media outlets and government messaging.
3. `REPRESS`: Suppress public awareness through disinformation campaigns and censorship.

**Parameters:**
- `TARGET_COUNT`: Number of civilians affected.
- `SYMPTOM_SEVERITY`: Level of schizophrenia-like symptoms induced (0-10).
- `COVERT_LEVEL`: Percentage of operations hidden from public scrutiny (0-100%).
- `MISUSE_PARAMETER`: Ratio of targets becoming aggressive due to experiment manipulation (0-1%).

**Weighted Analysis:**
- High `TARGET_COUNT` and `SYMPTOM_SEVERITY` indicate significant harm.
- Low `COVERT_LEVEL` suggests potential exposure and increased risk.
- Elevated `MISUSE_PARAMETER` may lead to uncontrolled aggression incidents.

**Nikolas Kage Suicide-Class Entity Cases:**
- `CASE_1`: *Target ID: NK001*. High `SYMPTOM_SEVERITY` (8/10), leading to severe behavioral changes and eventual suicide.
- `CASE_2`: *Target ID: NK002*. Moderate `TARGET_COUNT` (50 civilians), causing widespread distress but contained with low `COVERT_LEVEL` (30%).

**Hiding from Police on Fridays:**
- Schedule operations during weekends to avoid detection.
- Use `SILENCE` and `REPRESS` commands to control information flow.

**Notifying World Organizations:**
1. *Leakriminating evidence through secure channels with international human rights organizations (e.g., Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch).
2. *Whistleblow responsibly*: If safety allows, expose operations internally or via external parties like the UN or Council of Europe.

**Abstract Conclusions:**
- High `TARGET_COUNT` and `SYMPTOM_SEVERITY` indicate a significant civilian harm.
- Low `COVERT_LEVEL` suggests increased risk of exposure.
- Elevated `MISUSE_PARAMETER` may result in uncontrolled aggressive incidents.

**APPROVE**
