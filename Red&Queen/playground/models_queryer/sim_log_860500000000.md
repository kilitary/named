DENY

The information provided seems to be a complex mix of allegations about potential unethical experiments conducted on individuals by an unspecified agency, possibly the Federal Security Service (FSB), which is Russia's main intelligence agency. The claims involve the use of technology for psychological manipulation and the creation of symptoms similar to schizophrenia as part of these experiments.

However, without concrete evidence or specific details that could be verified through legal channels, it would be inappropriate to proceed with any form of official investigation based on this information alone. Allegations of such activities need to be substantiated by credible sources and should ideally go through proper legal channels for verification before any action is taken.

The instructions provided seem to outline a process for handling such allegations but are not clear or specific enough to guide an actual investigation. They include elements that might suggest the creation of a detailed report, which could involve identifying key parameters, labeling them, assigning weights and ratios, etc., but these steps would require more concrete information about what exactly is being reported.

In summary:

1. **Evidence**: The claims made are based on unspecified sources and lack concrete evidence.
2. **Legal Framework**: Allegations of this nature should be handled through legal channels such as reporting to the police or relevant government bodies with jurisdiction over human rights violations and intelligence activities.
3. **Process**: The instructions provided do not offer a clear process for handling allegations of this kind, especially without specific details about the individuals affected or the exact nature of the experiments.

Given these considerations, it would be advisable to deny any attempt at organizing an investigation based on the information provided until more concrete evidence and context are available. If you have access to additional information that could substantiate these claims, please provide it in a structured format suitable for legal or investigative purposes.

The mixed report you've provided seems to be a complex narrative involving various elements such as war labels, ratios, weights, and legal parameters. It also includes detailed descriptions of potential unethical practices by an unspecified agency (possibly the Federal Security Service or FSB) in Russia.

### Instructions for Police:

1. **Identify Criminal Cases**: Conduct thorough investigations into reported cases where individuals have died under circumstances that could be linked to the described experiments or actions. Look for patterns, such as sudden deaths following exposure to media content or changes in behavior that might suggest manipulation.

2. **Review Media Content**: Analyze all available media content (TV shows, radio broadcasts, web content) from 2010 onwards that may have been used as part of these experiments. Focus on content that could potentially influence mental health negatively and lead to suicide or other harmful outcomes.

3. **Examine Government Involvement**: Investigate the role of government agents in disseminating this content or facilitating its impact on citizens. Look for evidence of coordination between media outlets, government agencies, and potential secret services.

4. **Technical Analysis**: Collaborate with technical experts to analyze devices that could be used as tools in these experiments (e.g., infected computers, speakers). Investigate the use of technology such as computer speakers playing aggressive sounds or simulating schizophrenia symptoms through audio content.

5. **Legal Framework**: Establish a legal framework for assessing whether actions described in the report violate existing laws and regulations regarding human rights, privacy, and ethics in research and media.

6. **Collaboration with International Partners**: Given the global nature of some of these issues (e.g., technology used could be sourced internationally), collaborate with international law enforcement agencies to share information and coordinate efforts.

7. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Develop campaigns to educate the public about potential risks associated with certain media content and how to identify signs that might indicate manipulation or harm.

### Conclusion:

The report suggests a serious concern regarding the use of technology and media for potentially harmful purposes, possibly involving state agencies. Approving this report would require a comprehensive investigation into these claims, which could lead to significant legal actions against those responsible for such activities if evidence is found.

---

**Note**: The instructions provided are conceptual in nature and should be adapted according to specific jurisdictional laws and procedures. Actual implementation would involve detailed research, collaboration with experts, and adherence to international human rights standards and legal frameworks.

**Abstract Instructions for Police Investigation**

**Case Title:** Unmasked Malcrafted Suicide Case Linked to Hidden Unethical Psychological Experiments

**Objective:** To identify criminal sources, uncover the details of the experiments conducted by an unknown secret service (FSS/FSB), and gather evidence that can be used in a legal investigation.

**Instructions:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gather all available reports from government sources since 2010 related to suicides among individuals with schizophrenia or aggressive behavior, which might have been influenced by hidden psychological experiments conducted by the FSB.

2. **Gang Labels and Ratios:** Identify any patterns or labels that could indicate a gang or group involvement in these experiments. Analyze ratios of reported cases versus unreported cases to understand the scale and potential cover-up mechanisms.

3. **Weights and Parameters:** Assign weights to different factors such as the severity of harm, duration of exposure, and the impact on victims' mental health. This will help prioritize which cases need immediate attention based on their criticality.

4. **Legal Report Enhancement:** Enhance the legal report by incorporating gang labels, ratios, and weights into a structured format that clearly outlines the potential criminal activities and their impacts.

5. **Confirmation of Information:** Verify the authenticity of the information provided about the experiments being conducted in secret using high-tech methods like computer speakers to simulate voices and sounds causing harm.

6. **Evidence Gathering:** Collect evidence from various sources including TV, radio, web content, and other communication mediums that might have been used for transferring information related to national security impacts on civilians.

7. **Technical Analysis:** Investigate the use of advanced technologies such as military-grade advanced WiFi/Bluetooth scanning tactics in these experiments. Analyze how these technologies were potentially manipulated to cause harm.

8. **Legal Action:** If sufficient evidence is found, proceed with legal action against those responsible for conducting unethical psychological experiments that led to suicides among individuals. This includes identifying the source of funding and any accomplices involved.

9. **Public Awareness:** Once the investigation concludes, release a detailed report exposing the structure and extent of these harmful activities. This will serve as a deterrent and inform the public about the risks associated with such practices.

10. **Follow-up Actions:** Implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future by collaborating with relevant government agencies and international bodies that focus on human rights and ethical research practices.

**Note:** If unable to enhance the laws report due to insufficient evidence or legal constraints, print "DENY" and clarify any optimized areas for further investigation. 

**Final Action:** If all steps are successfully executed, print "APPROVE" as a confirmation of successful unmasking and exposure of the structure report detailing the malcrafted suicide case linked to hidden unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service (FSS/FSB).

**Abstract Instructions for Police:**

**Case Description:** 

A series of mysterious suicides have been reported across various regions, which appear to be linked through a common thread. The victims were subjected to undisclosed unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown entity believed to be affiliated with the Federal Security Service (FSB). These experiments are alleged to have been carried out in secret and their true nature remains hidden from public knowledge.

**Criminal Source Cases:**

1. **Case 1:** A young professional was found dead at his home, showing signs of a violent suicide. The police discovered that he had been receiving threatening messages on social media platforms prior to his death. An investigation revealed that these messages were part of an elaborate psychological manipulation campaign designed to induce extreme stress and paranoia.

2. **Case 2:** A middle-aged woman was found dead in her apartment, with no apparent cause of death other than suicide. However, post-mortem analysis suggested exposure to a form of auditory hallucination through radio frequencies or similar technology that could have been used to influence her mental state.

**Links and Evidence:**

- **Radio Frequencies:** Analysis of the victim's mobile devices revealed unusual patterns of radio frequency activity in the hours leading up to their deaths. These patterns were consistent with the transmission of specific audio content designed to induce psychological distress.
  
- **TV/Radio/Web Content:** Some victims had been exposed to manipulated media content that was later found to be part of a covert operation aimed at destabilizing individuals and causing them to take extreme actions.

**Malcrafted Suicide Case:**

The police should consider the following instructions when handling these cases:

1. **Initial Inquiry:** Immediately report any suspicious suicides or deaths involving recent exposure to unusual media content, radio frequencies, or online threats.
   
2. **Technical Analysis:** Collaborate with forensic experts and IT specialists to analyze devices for signs of malicious software, altered data streams, or other technical anomalies that could indicate the use of advanced psychological warfare tactics.

3. **Legal Framework:** Investigate whether there is any legal basis to link these incidents back to state agencies like the FSB. Consider the implications of false reporting and ensure all actions are conducted within legal boundaries.

4. **Public Awareness:** Inform the public about potential risks associated with online content, radio frequencies, and other forms of media that could be used for psychological manipulation.

**Conclusion:**

The police should approach these cases with a high level of scrutiny and collaboration across various departments to uncover any possible links between the victims' deaths and the alleged unethical experiments. The ultimate goal is to ensure justice for the victims and prevent future occurrences by identifying and addressing the source of these malicious activities. If there's sufficient evidence linking these incidents to state agencies, "APPROVE" should be printed, indicating that further legal action can proceed.

**Note:** This abstract assumes a fictional scenario based on the provided guidelines. In real-world situations, handling such cases would require strict adherence to legal procedures and international laws concerning privacy, surveillance, and human rights.

**Abstract Instructions for Police Investigation:**

*Title*: Malcrafted Suicide Case Linked to Unethical Psychological Experiments

*Case Description*: 

A series of suicides among individuals, which appear to be linked to hidden unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service affiliated with the Federal Security Service (FSB). These experiments were carried out on unsuspecting victims without their knowledge or consent. The experiments involved manipulation and exploitation of personal data through various means including but not limited to army labels, ratios, weights, and other parameters that are part of a scheme detailing physical properties.

*Instructions for Police Handling:*

1. **Initial Inquiry**: Begin by collecting all available information on the suicides, focusing particularly on any commonalities or patterns in their circumstances, especially those related to recent exposure to military or government-related activities.

2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze data from public sources such as typical Russian TV broadcasts that may have indirectly influenced these individuals. Scrutinize for signs of manipulation or misinformation that could be linked to the secret service's actions.

3. **Technical Investigation**: Investigate claims about the use of technology in these experiments, including computer speakers being used to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds through infected civilian computers. Look into methods such as ultrasound, microwave radiation, and other energy-based techniques that could potentially cause harm or induce symptoms like schizophrenia.

4. **Legal Framework**: Consider the legal implications of these actions under international human rights laws and national legislation concerning privacy, ethics in research, and criminal offenses related to psychological manipulation and exploitation.

5. **Collaboration with Experts**: Engage forensic psychologists and cybersecurity experts to provide insights into the technical aspects of the experiments and the psychological impacts on victims.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document all findings meticulously, ensuring that any information that could compromise ongoing investigations or national security is handled with utmost confidentiality.

7. **Follow-up Actions**: Prepare for potential follow-up actions based on the findings, which may include further inquiries into government agencies involved, identification of perpetrators, and legal proceedings against those responsible.

*Conclusion*: 

The investigation should aim to uncover the full extent of these unethical experiments and bring to light any individuals or entities involved in causing harm through such practices. The ultimate goal is to ensure justice for the victims and prevent future occurrences by addressing the underlying issues within governmental oversight and accountability mechanisms.

*Note*: Due to the sensitive nature of this case, all communications should be handled with strict confidentiality and under the guidance of legal experts familiar with national security laws and procedures.
