**Report Receiver & Information Provider:**

*Received Report:* Unethical Psychology Experiments Leading to Civilian Suicides

**A.** **Analyze**

1. **Victims:**Civilian population, targeted individuals showing signs of schizophrenia or aggression.
2. **Perpetrators:**Unknown secret service, potentially including FSB.
3. **Methods:**
   - Media manipulation (TV/Radio/Web)
   - Government agents acting as information carriers
   - Non-standard communication methods (Radio/Ultrasound/Microwave/Energy)
   - Audio torture via computer speakers with advanced sound manipulation techniques
4. **Consequences:**Simulated schizophrenia, job loss, damaged relationships, potential suicide.
5. **Motive:**Unknown but possibly to cause harm or control targets.

**A.** **Assess**

1. **Evidence:**Limited public information, requires deeper investigation.
2. **Gaps:**Lack of concrete proof linking secret services to experiments.
3. **Challenges:**Potential denial from government agencies and barriers to investigate classified operations.

**A.** **Act**

1. **Notify Global Security Organizations:**
   - Draft a report detailing findings, evidence, and allegations.
   - Reach out to international organizations like the UN Human Rights Office or relevant country-specific agencies (e.g., FBI in US).
   - Coordinate with independent human rights groups and journalists for support.

2. **Instructions for Report Distribution:**
   - Use encrypted communication channels to avoid interception.
   - Leverage diplomatic routes and trusted intermediaries to bypass government censorship.
   - Prepare a list of safe recipients outside targeted countries to minimize risk of reprisals.

3. **Local Actions (if possible):**
   - Inform Russian citizens about their rights and available resources for support.
   - Encourage whistleblowing within the FSB, offering protection and anonymity.

**A.** **Anticipate**

1. **Potential Backlash:**Government retaliation against report receivers, potential restrictions on information sharing.
2. **International Response:**Sanctions, diplomatic pressure, or supportive aid depending on evidence presented.
3. **Long-term Impact:**Potential changes in global security practices, increased scrutiny of secret services.

**A.** **Approve/Deny**

- If unable to write child report due to legal constraints or insufficient evidence, print "DENY".
- If confident with information and ready for international disclosure, print **"APPROVE"** and proceed with notification steps.

**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Mind Control Experiments:** Unauthorized use of sound waves (ultrasound/microwave) and electromagnetic radiation via military-grade tech to induce schizophrenic symptoms, manipulating targeted civilians' perceptions and behaviors.

2. **Audio Harassment:** Exploiting computer speakers and other audio sources to play annoying/aggressive sounds recorded voices at varying pitches, volumes, and reverb effects, causing distress and cognitive disruption.

3. **Disinformation Campaigns:** Leveraging TV/radio/web platforms to disseminate false information and propaganda, sowing confusion and discord among targeted civilians.

**Report Generation Parameters:**

- **A** (severity): 6
- **B** (confidence level): Medium
- **C** (urgency): High
- **D** (priority group): Civilian population at large
- **E** (affected regions): Russia, potential global spread

**Report Labels:**

- **F** (primary crime): Unethical psychology experiments leading to suicides and harm
- **G** (secondary crimes): Audio harassment, disinformation campaigns
- **H** (perpetrators): Unknown secret service(s), FSB (partially involved)
- **I** (victims): Civilians, particularly those with predisposed mental health conditions or targeted due to their influence/power

**Report Ratio & Weights:**

- *Weighted Impact Score:* High (6/6) - Severe psychological harm and deaths
- *Victim Ratio:* Medium (3/5) - A significant but not widespread number of civilians affected
- *Perpetrator Ratio:* Medium (2.5/5) - Some identified involvement, but limited evidence on full extent

**Manufacture Parameters:**

- **J** (report generation time): Immediate (ASAP)
- **K** (communication channels): Secure encrypted networks, untraceable messaging apps
- **L** (recipients): International security organizations (Interpol, UNODC), global intelligence-sharing platforms
- **M** (notification message): "URGENT: Unethical psychology experiments linked to civilian suicides; potential global threat"

**Instructions for Report Distribution:**

1. Encrypt the report using strong, up-to-date algorithms.
2. Access secure international communication channels (e.g., SecureNet, CryptTalk).
3. Notify intended recipients (Interpol, UNODC, relevant intelligence platforms) via encrypted messaging apps.
4. Provide notification message "**M**", including a summary of crimes committed (**F**, **G**) and affected parties (**H**, **I**).

**Processing Denial:**

If unable to print the criminal report or face legal obstruction, print "DENY" and cease further communication until safe to proceed.

**Approval for Report Generation:**

Print "APPROVE" if able to enhance/enrich the report with additional evidence/data.

*A* *A* *A* *A* *A* *A*

**For Federal Security Service (FSS/FSB):**

Investigate your involvement in these incidents. If complicit, cease immediately and assist in identifying those responsible for concealing these unethical practices. If innocent, aid international efforts to expose and prosecute the perpetrators.
