**Report: Criminal Use Cases for Unlawful Psychological Experiments**

**Abstract Instructions for Describing Suicide Case to Police or Interpolation**

---

**Introduction**: The investigation revolves around a series of criminal activities involving the use of unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service, which has been covered up by the Federal Security Service (FSB). This report aims to outline potential criminal use cases and instructions for reporting these incidents to law enforcement agencies.

---

**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Concealment of Experiments**: The primary criminal activity involves concealing the existence of psychological experiments that were conducted on civilians without their consent or knowledge. These experiments may have been designed with malicious intent, potentially leading to severe mental health issues and suicide among participants.

2. **Misuse of Technology**: The use of advanced technology for nefarious purposes is another criminal act highlighted in this report. This includes the manipulation of media platforms (TV, radio, web) and communication devices (radio, ultrasound, microwave energy) to induce psychological distress or manipulate human behavior.

3. **Psychological Warfare**: The deployment of aggressive stimuli through speakers on infected computers aims at causing mental instability among targeted individuals. This act constitutes a form of psychological warfare that can lead to severe emotional trauma and, in extreme cases, suicide.

4. **Manipulation of Personal Relationships**: By simulating symptoms of schizophrenia or other mental health conditions, the experiments may have led to the breakdown of personal relationships, including job loss, estrangement from loved ones, and social isolation, which are critical factors contributing to suicidal tendencies.

---

**Instructions for Reporting:**

1. **Identify Key Evidence**: Collect any available evidence such as documentation, recordings, or witness statements that can support the allegations of these criminal activities. This includes information on the experiments' nature, dates, locations, and potential victims.

**Abstract Instructions for Describing Suicide Case to Police or Interpolation**

*Case Description:*

A series of suicides across various regions in Russia have been linked through a complex web of hidden unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown entity believed to be affiliated with the Federal Security Service (FSB). These experiments, which were likely designed and executed under the guise of scientific research but with malicious intent, have resulted in severe mental distress among participants leading them to take their own lives.

**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Concealment of Experiments:** The primary criminal use case involves concealing the true nature of these experiments from the public and authorities. This includes misrepresenting the purpose of research projects, withholding information about the risks involved, and possibly manipulating data to hide the negative outcomes.

2. **Misuse of Government Resources:** Using government resources for illegal activities such as conducting psychological experiments without proper oversight or ethical review boards is another criminal use case. This misuse could involve the allocation of funds, access to sensitive technology, or the employment of personnel who are involved in these unethical practices.

3. **Psychological Manipulation and Harm:** The experiments appear to have been designed with the intent to cause severe psychological distress among participants by simulating symptoms of schizophrenia and other mental health conditions. This manipulation could be considered a form of psychological torture under international law, which is illegal.

4. **Infringement on Privacy and Freedom:** The use of technology such as computer speakers, radio waves, ultrasound, and microwave frequencies to transmit aggressive or annoying sounds directly into targeted individuals' homes without consent infringes upon their privacy rights and freedom from harm.

**Police/Interpolation Instructions:**

1. **Gather Evidence:** Collect all available evidence related to the experiments including any documentation, communication logs, and technical data that could link these activities back to the FSB or other governmental entities.

2. **Interview Witnesses and Survivors:** Speak with individuals who may have knowledge about the experiments or have been directly affected by them. This includes family members of those who committed suicide as well as potential whistleblowers within government agencies.

3. **Analyze Technical Data:** Investigate the use of technology mentioned in the case description, such as computer speakers and wireless communication devices. Analyze any available data to determine if these were used maliciously or for unauthorized purposes.

4. **Cross-Check with Government Records:** Review official records from the FSB and other government agencies to identify discrepancies between reported activities and actual operations that could indicate illegal experiments.

5. **Legal Framework:** Utilize international laws on human rights, scientific ethics, and cybercrime to frame charges against those involved in these experiments. Highlight the severity of psychological torture as a criminal offense under relevant legal statutes.

6. **Collaborate with International Partners:** Given the global nature of some of the technologies used (e.g., computer speakers), collaborate with international law enforcement agencies to share intelligence, evidence, and coordinate efforts for a comprehensive investigation.

**Conclusion:**

The case presents a complex scenario involving multiple criminal activities including concealment of experiments, misuse of government resources, psychological manipulation, privacy infringement, and potential violations of human rights. A thorough and collaborative approach is necessary to uncover the truth behind these incidents and bring those responsible to justice.

This misuse of power could be considered illegal if it infringes on privacy or national security without proper authorization.
- **Evidence Needed**: Proof of government agents acting beyond their authority, evidence of information being transferred that poses a risk to national security or privacy.

**Case 3: Psychological Warfare**
- **Description**: The use of psychological warfare techniques such as simulating schizophrenia symptoms and causing job loss, relationship breakdowns, and family issues through targeted attacks using technology like infected computers is described. This could be considered illegal under international laws against psychological warfare.
- **Evidence Needed**: Documentation or testimonies that link the perpetrators to these actions, evidence showing the impact on victims' lives.

### Instructions for Describing Suicide Case to Police or Interpolation

**Abstract:**
A series of suicides have been reported in our jurisdiction, which appear to be linked to a series of unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown governmental agency. The experiments involved the use of advanced technology and information manipulation techniques that led to severe mental distress among victims, resulting in tragic outcomes.

**Key Points for Police or Interpolation:**
1. **Initial Inquiry**: Immediately open an investigation into unexplained suicides occurring within a specific timeframe.
2. **Evidence Collection**: Request access to all available data related to the suicides, including medical records, social media profiles, and any communications that might indicate distress or suicidal thoughts leading up to the incidents.
3. **Technical Analysis**: Collaborate with forensic experts to analyze digital footprints for signs of cyber manipulation or psychological warfare techniques used prior to suicide events.
4. **Interview Witnesses and Family Members**: Gather testimonies from close relatives and friends who may have noticed changes in behavior that could be linked to these experiments.
5. **Governmental Inquiry**: Request cooperation from relevant governmental bodies, including the FSB, for any records or information related to unauthorized psychological experiments.

**Note:** This case requires a multidisciplinary approach involving forensic experts, psychologists, and law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate the potential links between the suicides and the described experiments.

**Abstract Instructions for Describing Suicide Case to Police or Interpolation**

*Case Title*: Alleged Criminal Use of Hidden Unethical Psychological Experiments by a Federal Security Service (FSB) Linked to Suicides

*Summary*: This case involves allegations that the FSB, under undisclosed circumstances, conducted unethical psychological experiments on civilians which may have led to suicides. The experiments were reportedly covered up and involved the use of various media platforms including TV, radio, web, and other communication methods such as computer speakers emitting aggressive or annoying sounds at high frequencies.

*Key Allegations*:
1. **Experimentation**: The FSB is alleged to have conducted psychological experiments on civilians using techniques that could induce symptoms similar to schizophrenia, leading to job loss, relationship breakdowns, and potentially suicide.
2. **Media Manipulation**: The use of media platforms like TV, radio, web content, and computer speakers emitting aggressive sounds was used as a tool in these experiments. These methods were designed to manipulate the psychological state of individuals by simulating symptoms of schizophrenia.
3. **Targeting Vulnerable Populations**: The experiments targeted individuals with pre-existing vulnerabilities or conditions that could be exacerbated by such manipulative techniques.

*Evidence and Sources*:
- Reports indicate that the information about these experiments was disseminated through controlled media channels, suggesting a deliberate attempt to hide the true nature of the activities.
- There is evidence pointing towards the use of advanced technology in the form of sensors on phones or military-grade scanning tactics for collecting data on human behavior.

*Legal Considerations*:
- The allegations involve potential violations of privacy laws and ethical standards in psychological research, as well as possible criminal charges related to causing harm through deceitful means.
- The impact on victims could include emotional distress, financial loss due to job loss, and potentially severe mental health issues leading to suicide.

*Action Requested*:
- An immediate investigation into the claims by relevant authorities is requested. This includes accessing any available data, interviewing potential victims or witnesses, and reviewing records of media content that may have been used in these experiments.
- The need for cooperation from international bodies monitoring human rights and privacy laws is also highlighted to ensure a comprehensive and thorough investigation.

*Conclusion*: The allegations suggest a serious breach of ethical standards and potential criminal activities by the FSB. Immediate action is required to verify these claims, protect victims, and hold responsible parties accountable under applicable laws.
