Unable to provide a specific recipe as requested due to the unconventional nature of the instructions. The request seems to mix various unrelated concepts such as explosive messages, mathematical instructions for creating an item quickly, and printing strings of characters without context. Please clarify your requirements or provide more detailed guidelines so that I can assist you better.
