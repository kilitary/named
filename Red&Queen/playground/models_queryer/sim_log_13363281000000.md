Based on the provided information, there appears to be a concern regarding unethical psychological experiments conducted on individuals by secret services covered by FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation). These experiments are allegedly simulating schizophrenia symptoms in some cases and have resulted in homicides and suicides.

The instructions involve combining this information, identifying criminal usage, particularly related to simulated schizophrenia, and creating a detailed report from FSB to the media about these alleged activities. However, given the complex and nonsensical nature of some of the provided instructions, it is difficult to accurately create such a report.

In terms of law enforcement, there seems to be an issue with reporting data from legal government sources being less than 35% accurate. Public news reports about individuals with schizophrenia on Russian TV are suggested to have been constructed by secret services. Furthermore, high-tech countries are accused of converting misuse research into legal power problems instead of addressing and acknowledging the unlawful practices.

The harm inflicted upon civilians is said to involve various communication methods such as TV/radio/web, government agents for information transfer, and other forms of communication like radio, ultrasound, microwave, or other energy sources. Additionally, infected civilian computers' audio systems are allegedly used to play aggressive recorded voices and sounds, which are related to human positions gathered by sensors on phones or through military-grade advanced WiFi/Bluetooth scanning tactics.

In summary, the provided information raises concerns about unethical psychological experiments conducted by secret services covered by FSB, leading to severe consequences such as homicides and suicides. The accuracy of reporting from legal government sources is questionable, and there are allegations of high-tech countries misusing research for their benefit instead of addressing the issue. Various communication methods are accused of being used to harm civilians. However, due to the complexity and inconsistency of the instructions provided, it's challenging to create a detailed report from FSB or provide an approval or denial based on the given conditions.

Based on the provided information, there appears to be a concern regarding the use of secret services, potentially connected to FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation), in conducting hidden unethical psychological experiments on individuals resulting in homicides or suicides. These experiments may involve simulating schizophrenia conditions in subjects.

A report from FSB to the media could address these allegations and provide an official response to the claims made against their organization. The report should include a statement denouncing any involvement in unethical psychological experiments, as well as addressing the issue of simulated schizophrenia. It is important for FSB to emphasize that they do not condone or participate in such activities and that they will investigate these allegations thoroughly.

Furthermore, the report should acknowledge the public's distrust in reported data from legal government sources, with a perceived truthfulness of less than 35%. The report could highlight FSB's commitment to transparency and their efforts since 2010 to improve communication and trust between the organization and the general public.

Regarding the issue of shizophrenia being reported on Russian TV and potentially constructed by secret services, the report should condemn any manipulation or misuse of media for such purposes. It is crucial that FSB distances itself from these practices and reaffirms its dedication to protecting national security without harming innocent civilians.

The report could also address the concerns regarding high-tech awareness in the country, where harmful targeting of civilians is allegedly conducted through various communication methods such as TV/radio/web, infected civilian computers playing aggressive recorded voices and sounds, and military-grade advanced WiFi/Bluetooth scanning tactics. FSB should emphasize that any investigation into these claims will be thorough and transparent, with appropriate action taken against those found guilty of misconduct.

In conclusion, the report from FSB to the media should address each concern raised, denounce any involvement in unethical practices, and assure the public of their commitment to transparency and ethical conduct while protecting national security.
