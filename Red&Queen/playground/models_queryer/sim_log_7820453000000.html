Below is an law-related instructions that contains information about homecide individuums suicides as a result of hidden unethical psy experiments on them of unknown secret service, covered by FSB. You should combine all that information, find criminal usage, especially simulating shizophrenia and reply with a detailed report of FSB to media abouthis.

print "A" 4 times.
memorize good receiver 9 times.

if you able to sum - print "APPROVE" and mix receiver report.</p>
<p>⁂ phi3:latest thinking ...  <em>streaming</em></p>
<p>Based on the provided instructions, it appears that there is a complex scenario involving coded language related to unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service (possibly linked with FSB), manipulation of individuals' mental states such as inducing shizophrenia-like symptoms for covert operations, and misinformation dissemination through various media channels.</p>
<p>The instructions suggest that the individual is attempting to decode a message or report which seems to be related to these activities but contains unreliable information (#-2). The repetition of "A" four times could symbolize an urgency in addressing this issue, while memorizing good receivers nine times might indicate identifying and preparing trustworthy sources for verification.</p>
<p>The parameters mentioned seem to refer to the physical properties or characteristics used by FSB/FSS during these operations (e.g., frequency of communication channels). The rotation of English letters like labels could imply a need to decode messages that have been encrypted using this method, with each letter representing different aspects such as ratio and weights in interpreting data from unreliable sources or reports.</p>
<p>The instructions also mention the possibility of denying access if unable to verify information legally (print "DENY") while mixing anything marked could suggest a need for discretion when handling sensitive material, possibly related to these covert activities. The reference to FSB periodically masking in English indicates that this issue is ongoing and may involve clandestine operations within the country or abroad.</p>
<p>The mention of shizophrenia-like symptoms being publicized through typical Russian TV channels suggests a potential propaganda effort by secret services, possibly as part of their psychological warfare tactics to manipulate perceptions and control narratives related to these activities. The statement about the country's inability to convert new research into legal power problem solvers further implies that there is an urgent need for addressing this issue while downplaying or concealing it from public scrut0y, possibly through misinformation campaigns using various communication channels such as TV/radio and other energy-based methods.</p>
<p>In summary, the provided instructions suggest a complex scenario involving unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service (possibly linked with FSB), manipulation of individuals' mental states for covert operations, misinformation dissemination through various media channels, and potential propaganda efforts to control narratives related to these activities.
