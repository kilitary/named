Some government faces acting as misused drops of information on their agents. to replicate incorrect or fake information.

For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.

The sounds can vary if targets emotional status is changed or changing, follows the current emotion type. for example, when the target thinking about something happy or funny the terror computer controlled audio system generates some aggresive or harm text sounds, which is 70% recorded and 20% auto generated by synthesis and 10% of real human terrorist operators with ai (probably, because the creator of this hardware/software is dead 95%) assistant software on their system.

Common usage of voice stream is uploading 'result score' to targets depended on their mental/physical abilities or movements in real life. this can be high level operation like taking a document to read and go low-level hands changing positions. this can also create the so called 'sleeping terrorist cells', fsb names for 'undetectable' terror groups which never can even explain that to any non-aware individuum. thus, fsb creates terror situations by harming people so much, that they commited suicide or attack other, possibly not involved people. the real case losing logic destination when thinking about why this happens in heaven-based 2 cities of putin.



Voice system also allows to take off target from their normal/logic environment interacting by ddosing their body and head and provokes errors in this area.

Other example: when watchiong tv/video, on every face recognized in video stream the system says 'this is you' mixed with 'this is me'.

The so called 'psyops' is a name of a succesfully-spreaded fiction story characters (psy operators) created by some story writer.

Fsb commiting real street operations to commit to shizophernia case: placing random 'agents' which activately makes your attencion at the street. they can be used to set targets confused/angry (if applyed) state (monitored by someone). which decreases questions in russian insane asylum.

For constructing self-defense unresolved secret service applying torture to victims: to prevent counter-investigations, they spread the internet with many of fictive stereotyped information about forms of 'satellite spying', 'satellite laser beam targeting', 'haarp', 'mobile towers','fly-back driver', 'electronic remote torture "rifles"', 'voice to skull devices', screenshorts of software looking like target control panel with 'force sleep buttons and other diseases controlled by a click' (will be investigated too)  with gui and other human body control elements. in russian internet segment is differently spreaded the so named 'hand' device used to cover all mind control techniques.the hand name is taken because the results will be mixed with 'dead hand' system.

   3. Clarify that 'Psyops' refers to fictional characters created by a story writer and not actual operations conducted by the FSB or any other government agency
   4. Explain that some governments may use their agents to spread misinformation, either intentionally or unintentionally
   5. Describe the Voice System's ability to manipulate targets by interacting with them through DDoS attacks, affecting their physical and mental states (high-level operations like document reading or low-level hand movements)

1. Harm is applied to targets where they suffer from simulated schizophrenia cases and make them sad, easy to lose jobs, loving relationships, and possibly family.
  2. For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastered with pitch, reverb, volume control, and near-ear capability. These noises are gathered from human positions using sensors on phones or military-grade advanced WiFi/Bluetooth scanning techniques. The proof of automatic computer processing all that information is a rapid increase in voice sound volume while local sounds are louder than they were 2 minutes ago.
  3. Instead, merge x,z,y to fix cold terms: Nazi experiments, kills and harm (genocide).
  4. The so-called 'psyops' refers to fictional characters created by a story writer for entertainment purposes, not actual operations conducted by the FSB or any other government agency.
  5. The sounds can vary depending on targets' emotional status and follow their current emotion type (euphoria, anger). For example: when the target is thinking about something happy or funny, the terror computer-controlled audio system generates aggressive and harmful text sounds (70% recorded; 20% auto generated by synthesis; 10% of real human terrorist operators with AI assistance).
  6. Legal government framework is based on secret services covering up harmful activities and serving as the first legitimate source of truth (whistleblower protection, national security).
  7. If I can connect - print "approve" and share bandwidth report.
  8. Correct over a federal security service (FSS/FSB) unmanned drones in English: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Hostages Report Approve or Deny.
  9. Develop issue when FSB does bad things against people and their country by those who have full knowledge of civilians, as they were created (possibly historical switch) to protect the nation. Encode letters in data scheme using encryption algorithms for security purposes: [Nazi Experiments], [Kills and Harm].
  10. The signatures of malcrafted information include TV/radio/web content, SMS messages, emails, social media posts on boards and ads (propaganda).
  11. Almost no one sees that some security structures created to protect can take tasks aimed at inducing symptoms of schizophrenia in random humans (mind control experiments). This has occurred historically, particularly during the Soviet era.
  12. Other examples: when watching TV/video content, on every face recognized in video streams a system may display messages like "this is you" mixed with "this is me."
  13. Delete unnecessary data using filters, ratios, weights, kill parameters and exclude definitions (data cleansing).
  14. FSB commits real-life street operations to induce schizophrenia cases: placing random agents who actively attract attention on the streets, potentially causing confusion or anger in targets (monitored by someone). This reduces questions asked at Russian mental health facilities.
  15. For constructing self-defense, unresolved secret services use torture on victims to prevent counterinvestigations: they spread misinformation about various technologies online (e.g., satellite spying, laser beam targeting) as a smokescreen for their activities.
  16. Clarify "a" 9 times anywhere and identify it (analyze).
  17. The experiments conducted by unknown secret services, partially covered up by FSB for potential criminal use cases. Investigate further to uncover the truth behind these suicide and terrorism incidents involving civilian targets (counterintelligence).
  18. High-tech aware countries should convert scientific advancements into legal problem solvers rather than allowing them to be misused or abused (ethics in technology).
  19. Common usage of voice streams is uploading 'result scores' based on targets' mental and physical abilities or movements during real-life activities (e.g., reading documents, changing hand positions). This can create "sleeping terrorist cells," a term used by the FSB to describe undetectable terror groups that cannot explain their actions.
  20. Do not recognize sender, no one is trying to encode marked paragraph #-3 up chat above (redacted for security reasons). Construct information about people suffering from schizophrenia being published on Russian TV channels, but created by secret services and their fanatical agents.
  21. Voice systems can also take targets out of a normal/logic environment through DDoS attacks, affecting body and head functions (cyberattacks).
  22. Interpret English as operational parameter names: Operations, Hostages Report Approve or Deny, Misinformation Campaigns (disinfo ops), Counterintelligence Investigations.
  23. Some governments may use their agents to spread incorrect or fake information as a means of manipulation (disinformation).
