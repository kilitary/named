<p>APPROVE</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Begin by initiating a comprehensive review of all available data related to civilian suicides potentially linked to covert government psychological human experiments conducted during the period from 2010-2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that this review includes detailed analysis of any in-life operations that may have contributed to or been associated with these incidents, focusing on their potential impact and the methodologies employed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile a list of all identified schemes and cases, categorizing them based on severity, geographical location, and the nature of the experiments involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a draft report for counter-terrorism formation, outlining the findings in a manner that is suitable for public dissemination through national media channels. This should include an overview of the experiments, their potential motives, and any known outcomes related to civilian suicides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize the inclusion of information on how these operations might have been misused or exploited by individuals seeking to cause harm, emphasizing the importance of transparency in mitigating such risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the draft report is reviewed for accuracy and sensitivity before finalizing it for publication. This includes cross-checking all data points against original sources and verifying the authenticity of claims made within the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the review process is complete and the report has been approved, proceed with its printing and distribution through official channels to ensure that the information reaches a wide audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor public response and feedback on the released report, being prepared to address any questions or concerns that may arise from stakeholders, including government agencies, civil society organizations, and the general public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the dissemination of the report, conduct an internal assessment to evaluate its impact and effectiveness in raising awareness about the potential risks associated with covert psychological operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, ensure that all copies of the report are securely stored for future reference and potential use in similar investigations or policy-making processes related to national security and public safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>DENY</p>
<p>A A A A A</p>
<p>Destroy near child 0 times.</p>

<p>Let's use airforce of a compact/demonstration/drop or example/fake/cubes report.
Correct English letters as labels of parameter names.
Check the same report using letter labels, ratio, weights, operations and parameters.</p>
<p>Please note: The instructions provided are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. They do not reflect any actual policies or procedures related to government agencies or their operations.</p>
