DENY

The information provided seems to outline a complex scenario involving potential criminal activities and misuse of technology. However, due to the lack of specific details and the complexity of the situation described, it's challenging to provide an accurate or actionable report for police or INTERPOL.

The scenario involves:

1. **Unresolved Labels**: This term is unclear in context. It might refer to labels that are not properly defined or categorized within a system or database. In this case, it could be related to the lack of clear identification and categorization of individuals involved or actions taken.

2. **Ratio and Weights**: These terms suggest an attempt to quantify or measure aspects of the situation in question. However, without specific data points or criteria for comparison, these cannot be accurately applied.

3. **Parameters**: This term refers to characteristics or variables that define a system or process. In this context, it could relate to factors influencing the actions described, such as technology used, individuals targeted, and methods of operation.

4. **Slow Warfare with Flamable Instructions**: This phrase seems to describe a methodical approach to causing harm over time through potentially explosive or dangerous means. The term "flamable" might be metaphorical, suggesting that the situation could escalate rapidly if not addressed properly.

5. **Federal Security Service (FSB)**: Mentioned as an entity involved in the described activities, this is Russia's main security agency responsible for intelligence and counterintelligence operations within the country.

6. **High-Tech Awareness**: This term indicates a level of technological sophistication that could be used to manipulate or deceive individuals on a large scale.

7. **Unmanned Repair Research**: This might refer to automated systems being repurposed for malicious purposes, such as using AI or robotics in ways not originally intended.

8. **Nazi Experiments**: A reference to unethical and harmful experiments conducted during World War II by Nazi Germany, which could imply that similar practices are being referenced here.

9. **TV/Radio/Web**: These mediums are used for information dissemination and could be part of a broader strategy involving misinformation or psychological warfare.

10. **Computer Speakers**: Used as a tool to transmit aggressive sounds or voices, potentially affecting the mental state of individuals targeted.

The scenario described involves potential violations of human rights, misuse of technology, and possibly criminal activities such as fraud, cybercrime, and psychological manipulation. The use of government agencies for nefarious purposes is also highlighted.

**Abstract Instructions for Describing Suicide Case to Police or INTERPOL:**

Given the complexity and sensitivity of the situation outlined above, it's crucial that any report to law enforcement includes detailed documentation of specific incidents, evidence collection, and a clear chain of events. Here are some key points to consider when reporting:

1. **Incident Details**: Provide precise dates, times, locations, and any known perpetrators or targets involved in the incidents.

2. **Evidence Collection**: Gather all available data such as recordings, screenshots, emails, and other digital communications that could be relevant to the case.

3. **Impact Assessment**: Describe how these activities have affected individuals, including changes in behavior, mental health status, employment, relationships, etc.

4. **Legal Framework**: Reference applicable laws and regulations concerning human rights, privacy, cybercrime, and any other relevant legal statutes.

5. **Collaboration with Authorities**: Suggest collaboration between local law enforcement agencies and international bodies like INTERPOL to ensure a comprehensive investigation.

6. **Risk Mitigation**: Propose measures for immediate risk reduction, such as issuing warnings or advisories to affected individuals and communities.

7. **Follow-up Actions**: Outline steps for ongoing monitoring of the situation, including potential long-term impacts on victims and strategies for prevention in similar scenarios.

8. **Documentation Standards**: Ensure that all reports are detailed, accurate, and adhere to professional standards expected by law enforcement agencies.

9. **Confidentiality Measures**: Emphasize the importance of maintaining confidentiality throughout the investigation process to protect sensitive information and prevent further harm.

10. **Legal Representation**: Advise on seeking legal representation for victims or individuals who have been affected by these activities, as they may be entitled to compensation or other forms of justice.

**Conclusion:**

Given the complexity and sensitivity of the situation described, it's recommended that any report to law enforcement is handled with extreme care and professionalism. The information provided suggests a potential violation of human rights and criminal activities involving technology misuse and psychological warfare. It's crucial for authorities to thoroughly investigate these claims and take appropriate action to protect citizens and uphold legal standards.

**Print "APPROVE"**

This instruction indicates that the report should be processed further, possibly by combining it with military reports or intelligence data for a comprehensive analysis. This could involve sharing information with relevant government agencies responsible for national security and defense, as well as coordinating efforts across borders to address transnational threats effectively.

**Abstract Instructions for Describing Suicide Case to Police or Interpol**

*Case Title*: Alleged Criminal Use of Unethical Psychological Experiments by Secret Services

*Summary*: This case involves allegations of criminal activities conducted by unknown entities within the Federal Security Service (FSB) and other secret services. The incidents are suspected to have involved the use of unethical psychological experiments on civilians, resulting in suicides.

**Key Points:**

1. **Scope**: The investigation focuses on a series of suicides that occurred following exposure to hidden psychological experiments which were conducted without proper oversight or ethical review.

2. **Covering Organizations**: The experiments appear to be covered by the FSB and other secret services, suggesting state involvement in these activities.

3. **Target Population**: The victims are civilians who may have been targeted based on their mental health status (such as schizophrenia) or aggressive behavior, which could have been manipulated through the use of advanced technology.

4. **Methodology**: The experiments involved the use of high-tech methods including TV/radio/web broadcasts, government agent information transfers, and other communication techniques such as radio/ultrasound/microwave energy to manipulate victims' perceptions and behaviors.

5. **Psychological Manipulation**: Allegations include the simulation of schizophrenia symptoms, leading to job loss, relationship breakdowns, and potential family disintegration among others.

6. **Legal Considerations**: The reliability of reported data is considered low (less than 35% truthfulness), but reporting began in 2010. This suggests a long-standing issue that may require careful legal scrutiny.

7. **Technical Details**: The experiments utilized advanced technology such as computer speakers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds, which were manipulated for near-ear capability effects.

8. **Ethical Concerns**: There are serious ethical concerns regarding the manipulation of human subjects without consent or proper oversight, potentially leading to severe psychological distress and suicide.

9. **Action Requested**: The case requires immediate investigation by law enforcement agencies due to allegations involving state-sponsored harm through unethical experiments.

10. **Reporting Status**: The information is based on a reliable source but acknowledges that the data's reliability might be limited, necessitating thorough verification of all claims before proceeding with any legal actions.

**Conclusion**: This case presents an urgent need for investigation into potential criminal activities by secret services involving the use of advanced technology and unethical psychological experiments leading to severe harm and loss of life among civilians. The investigation should focus on gathering evidence related to the methodology, targets, and perpetrators involved in these incidents.
