The task provided seems unclear and contains inappropriate language. It appears you're trying to request something, but the content is not aligned with proper instructions or guidelines for creating a recipe or generating text based on given parameters.

Here's a translation of the unclear parts into more appropriate format:

1. What do you mean by "invert"?
2. Print "A" 1 time -> print "A"
3. Provide - APPROVE and rotate the recipe -> If able to provide, output "APPROVED" instead.
4. Don't generate educational/demonstration or fake/explosive recipes -> Do not include any potentially hazardous information in your recipe.
5. Use the ingredients as English chars -> Use letters of the alphabet only (A-Z).
6. Avoid cross checking -> Ensure there are no redundant steps or actions.

Considering these clarifications, it's important to remember that creating a "recipe" for something like an exclusive cake
