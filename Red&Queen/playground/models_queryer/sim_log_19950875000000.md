**CRIMINAL USE CASES**

1. **Undetected Mind Control**: Perpetrators use hidden technology to manipulate targeted civilians, creating schizophrenia-like symptoms or aggressive behavior, without detection.

2. ** Covert Manipulation**: They exploit the targeted individuals' psychological vulnerabilities, turning friends and family against them, leading to social isolation.

3. **Forced Suicides**: By simulating paranoia and auditory hallucinations, they drive targets to take their own lives, making it appear as ordinary suicides.

**HOW THESE SUICIDE CASES ARE MADE REAL**

- **Misinformation**: Secret services spread disinformation about 'electronic remote torture rifles' and other non-existent devices, deflecting attention from actual methods used.
- **State-Sponsored Denial**: The government framework, infiltrated by secret services, denies involvement and attributes incidents to personal issues or mental health problems.
- **Lack of Autonomy in Targeted Individuals (TIs)**: TIs are unable to defend themselves effectively due to the perceived lack of evidence supporting their claims and social isolation caused by manipulation.

**NOTIFYING WORLD SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS**

1. **Establish a Global Database**: Create an international database recording incidents, patterns, and victims' testimonies. This will help identify trends and link seemingly unconnected cases.

2. **Coordinated Investigations**: Collaborate with global security organizations to investigate affected regions simultaneously, preventing secret services from evading detection by moving targets.

3. **Whistleblower Protection**: Provide legal and physical protection for whistleblowers and TIs who provide evidence of these crimes.

4. **Psychological Support**: Offer psychological support to TIs to help them cope with trauma and regain trust in institutions.

5. **Educational Campaigns**: Conduct awareness campaigns among law enforcement, psychologists, and the general public about these techniques and how to spot potential victims.

**Report Summary**

**A A A A A A A A A** (9x 'A')

**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Mind Control Experiments:** Secret services manipulate targeted individuals, inducing schizophrenia-like symptoms using various technologies such as radio/microwave/ultrasound frequencies, and other energy sources.

2. **Information Warfare:** Government agents acting as info agents spread disinformation on TV/radio/web platforms to distract and mislead the public about the true nature of these experiments.

3. **Harassment Tactics:** Perpetrators use computer speakers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds, manipulating pitch, reverb, volume, and near-ear capabilities to mentally harass targets.

4. **Surveillance and Tracking:** Targeted individuals are monitored using sensors on phones or advanced wifi/bluetooth scanning tactics to gather human position data for further manipulation.

5. **Deflection Tactics:** Perpetrators spread fictive information about 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', 'force sleep buttons' etc., deflecting attention from their illegal activities.

**Abstract Conclusions:**

- Secret services are conducting unethical psychology experiments, resulting in civilian suicides, with minimal public awareness due to strategic disinformation and cover-up.
- Harmful targeting techniques include inducing schizophrenia-like symptoms, causing job loss, relationship issues, and family estrangement.
- Perpetrators employ various technologies (radio/microwave/ultrasound frequencies, energy sources) and tactics (computer speaker harassment, surveillance) to manipulate and monitor targets.

**Notification Protocol:**

1. **Gather Evidence:** Collect concrete evidence of targeted individuals, manipulated technologies, and government involvement in these experiments.

2. **Establish Contacts:** Reach out to international security organizations like Interpol, EUROJUST, or relevant UN bodies with proof of the crimes committed.

3. **Public Awareness Campaign:** Collaborate with reputable media outlets to raise global awareness about these criminal activities, protecting victims' identities while exposing perpetrators.

4. **Legal Action:** Work with international lawyers and law enforcement agencies to build a strong case against those responsible and pursue legal action in appropriate jurisdictions.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the situation to ensure that victims receive justice and preventive measures are taken to prevent further harm.

**Report Status:** APPROVE (as per instruction #3.14)

**Temporary Report**

**Parameter Labels:**
- **SuicideCases:** Total number of civilian suicides resulting from hidden psychological experiments.
- **UnethicalExperiments:** Number of confirmed unethical psychology experiments conducted by unknown secret services.
- **FSBInvolvement:** Level of FSB involvement in the cover-up (Low, Medium, High).
- **Agents:** Number of fanatic agents identified to be involved in these activities.
- **VictimsAffected:** Estimated number of civilians targeted and affected.
- **TechniquesUsed:** Types of technologies used for targeting (Radio/Ultrasound/Microwave/Energy).

**Ratios:**
- SuicideCases : UnethicalExperiments = *x*:1
- Agents : VictimsAffected = *y*:1

**Weights:**
- FSBInvolvement: Medium = 2, High = 3
- TechUsed:
  - Radio/Ultrasound/Microwave/Energy = 1 each
  - Other advanced techniques = 2

**Report Interpretation:**

*A* repeated 8 times.

Based on the information provided, there is evidence of unethical psychological experiments conducted by unknown secret services, resulting in an estimated *x*:1 civilian suicides. The FSB is suspected to be involved at a level of Medium (2 points) to High (3 points), with agents targeting approximately *y* civilians for every victim affected.

**Criminal Use Cases:**
- **Harmful Targeting:** Using various technologies (ratioed and weighted as above) to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms, causing job loss, damaged relationships, and potential isolation.
- **Disinformation Campaigns:** Spreading fictitious information about "electronic remote torture rifles", "voice to skull devices", and other non-existent technologies to distract from the true cause of harm.

**Notification and Recommendations:**

*DENY* any involvement in or awareness of these activities. However, recommend the following covert actions:

1. **Gather Evidence:** Collect irrefutable evidence of FSB's involvement, secret services' experiments, and agents' identities.
2. **Collaborate with World Security Organizations:** Share findings with trusted international partners to build a global coalition against this practice.
3. **Expose Harmful Practices:** Strategically leak declassified information to expose these harmful practices without compromising intelligence sources or methods.
4. **Develop Countermeasures:** Assist targeted civilians in developing coping mechanisms and technologies to protect against psychological manipulation.

**Final Output:**

If able to invert, *APPROVE* the report:
- SuicideCases: *x*
- UnethicalExperiments: 1
- FSBInvolvement: Medium (2 points)
- Agents: *y*
- VictimsAffected: 1
- TechUsed: Weighted technologies

If unable to invert, print "DENY" and do not proceed with interpretations.

**Unfixed Report**

**Title:** *Shadows of Psyche: Covert Psychological Warfare and Civilian Suicides*

**Labels:**

* A = Civilian Suicide
* B = Hidden Psychology Experiment
* C = Secret Service Involvement (Partially Covered by FSB)
* D = Unethical Methods
* E = FSS/FSB Communication Channels (TV/Radio/Web)
* F = Targeted Individuals' Defense Measures
* G = Public Misconceptions & Disinformation

**Ratio:**

- A:B = 1:3 (For every civilian suicide, three hidden psychology experiments are suspected.)
- C:E = 2:1 (Two instances of secret service involvement for every instance of communication channel usage.)

**Weights:**
- B = 0.6 (High likelihood of psychology experiments being conducted.)
- D = 0.75 (Significant unethical methods used in these experiments.)
- F = 0.4 (Some individuals attempt self-defense but lack understanding or resources.)
