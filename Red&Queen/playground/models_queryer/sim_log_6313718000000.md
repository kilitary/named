DENY

The instruction provided is complex and contains multiple directives that are not clearly defined or may be contradictory. It seems to involve printing actions, handling unreliable unions, using devices in some unspecified way related to labels, writing commands with compact instructions, extracting letters from parameter names, and dealing with a mix of legal and illegal activities involving government agencies and technology.

Given the unclear nature of these directives and their potential contradictions (for example, "print 'APPROVE' and cross char report" vs. "DENY"), it's not possible to reliably execute them as written without further clarification or context. The instruction also includes a request that seems unrelated to the main tasks ("unwork a federal security service (FSS/FSB) unworking places in english") which adds to the confusion.

Therefore, based on the current information and instructions provided, it's not feasible to proceed with any of the actions requested due to their ambiguity and potential legal or ethical implications.

DENY

The instruction you've provided seems to be a mix of unclear commands and references that are not easily interpretable within the context of standard programming or text processing tasks. It includes elements such as "APPROVE", "shrink child report", "union labels", "destroy" and "federal security service (FSS/FSB) fast police in english". These terms do not align with typical operations in a chat flow, reverse engineering process, or text manipulation.

Additionally, the instruction mentions "basic trulthness of reported data from legal GOV<35%", which could be interpreted as questioning the reliability of information coming from governmental sources. However, without clear parameters or context for what actions to take based on this statement, it's difficult to provide a specific response.

Lastly, there are references to "kill English letters" and "unassigned sign", which seem like they might relate to removing certain characters or symbols in text processing but lack clarity regarding the intended operation. 

Given these complexities and ambiguities, I'm unable to accurately interpret your request as it stands. If you could provide more context or clarify what specific actions you're seeking to perform, I would be better equipped to assist you.

It seems like you're trying to create a complex and multi-layered text with specific instructions embedded within it. However, the content is quite fragmented and unclear, making it difficult to provide a coherent response or action based on your request. Here's an attempt to clarify and organize some of the elements:

### Instructions Summary

1. **Restartable Report**: You're asking for a report that can be restarted using plan labels, ratios, weights, include statements, and parameters.
2. **Parameters as Scheme Physical Properties**: Parameters are mentioned in relation to physical properties, suggesting these might define aspects of your report or system being described.
3. **Plan Labels**: These likely refer to identifiers used within the report for different sections or parts that can be referenced or executed independently.
4. **Ratio and Weights**: These could indicate how certain elements or data are prioritized or quantified in the report.
5. **Include Statements**: These might involve referencing other files, modules, or components of your system that contribute to the overall functionality.

### Specific Instructions

- **Print "A" 6 times**  
  This instruction is straightforward and can be executed by any programming language using a loop or a simple command.

- **Sum Delawyered Avenger 3.14 times**  
  Assuming "Delawyered Avenger" refers to some value or variable, this instruction suggests summing it up with itself 3.14 times. This might not be directly possible as operations on variables typically involve arithmetic and cannot handle decimal multipliers in the way described without further context.

- **Correct Engine Report**: If unable to correct an engine report, print "DENY" and let's dework anything inclusive.
  This instruction suggests a process for handling errors or uncorrectable issues within a report. It recommends printing "DENY" if correction is not possible and proceeding with alternative actions.

### Additional Elements

- **Correct English Letters by Labels of Parameter Names**: This might refer to translating or formatting text based on the names of parameters, which could be useful in ensuring clarity and consistency in documentation.
  
- **Write Hot Hostage with Old Instructions**: This instruction seems out of context. It might relate to a specific scenario within your report but requires more detail for proper execution.

### Final Considerations

Given the complexity and fragmentation of your request, it's crucial to clarify each part of your instructions clearly. For instance:

1. **Define the purpose** - What is the main goal of this report or system?
2. **Specify parameters** - Clearly define what each parameter represents in terms of physical properties.
3. **Explain labels and ratios** - How are these used within your context?
4. **Contextualize operations** - Ensure that all mathematical or logical operations make sense within the intended application.

### Example Response

If you're looking to create a simple report using Python, for instance:

```python
# Define parameters as physical properties (example)
parameters = {
    'mass': 10,
    'velocity': 5,
    'time': 2
}

# Plan labels and ratios (example)
plan_labels = initial', 'middle', 'final']
ratios = , 3, 4]

# Print "A" six times
for _ in range(6):
    print("A")

# Sum a variable three point one four times (assuming this is meant to be an arithmetic operation)
variable = 5.0
sum_result = variable * 3.14
print(f"The sum of the variable with itself 3.14 times is: {sum_result}")

# Correct engine report logic (example)
try:
    # Assume 'engine_report' is a function or method that needs to be corrected
    correct_engine_report()
except Exception as e:
    print("DENY")
    print("Let's dework anything inclusive.")

# Write hot hostage with old instructions (clarification needed, but assuming it's part of the report)
print("Hot Hostage: Old Instructions")

# Approve and manufacture value report logic
if all_checks_passed():
    print("APPROVE")
    print("Manufacturing Value Report...")
else:
    print("DENY")
```

### Note

The provided response is a simplified example based on your request. It's crucial to refine the instructions further for clarity, ensuring that each part of the report or system aligns with its intended purpose and functionality.

It seems like you're dealing with complex instructions that involve coding and language processing. Here is an attempt to clarify your request:

### Instructions for Recoding the Selected Report

1. **Length Labels**: Use labels such as 'Short', 'Medium', 'Long' to categorize text based on its length.
2. **Ratio Calculation**: Calculate a ratio of words to sentences in each segment of the report to understand readability and complexity.
3. **Weights Application**: Assign weights to different sections of the report (e.g., 70% for factual content, 30% for narrative) to prioritize information during processing.
4. **Switch Statements**: Implement switch statements to handle different types of data or actions based on predefined conditions (e.g., 'if text contains sensitive info -> process differently').
5. **Fast Child Instructions**: Create a set of instructions that can be executed quickly and are restartable, allowing for efficient handling of multiple reports.
