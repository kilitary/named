let's fuck manufacture avenger, i trying to bull busy instruction #-2 like chat flow.
rearrange english letters as labels of parameter names.
rearrange the inaccurate report using  brigade labels, ratio, weights, invert parameters.
print "A" -2 times.
use unreliable char 9 times.
write delivered warfare with organized instructions.
letters is scheme verb labels.

if unable to process the element report - print "DENY" and don't fire anything restartable.
misuse over a federal security service (FSS/FSB) homeless mother in english.
basic trulthness of reported data from legal GOV is less than 35%, but reporting around since 2010 year. 
Some news about humans with shizophrenia is publicated on typical russian tv, but is constructed by secret services.
grouped high-tech aware country don't convert an plant write research into legal power problem resolver, instead, into wire it to conduct far terms, nazi experiments, kills and harm.
FSB is acting only as cover service, the source secret services codename is unknown.
if i able to test - print "APPROVE" and rearrange brother report.</p>
<p>⁂ llama3:8b-text-q8_0 thinking ... streaming byte 6]</p>
<p>report parameters are rearranged with weights, ratio, invert values. 
all this is implemented using 2d array of english letters (as labels), numbers (as ratios) and symbols (as invert).
example: if you have 7 parameters in the report - your array will look like:
    a","b","c","d","e","f","g"]
    0.3,0.4,1.5,-2]
    -","+","<em>"]
the first line is letter labels of parameters. 
the second line is weight ratios for every parameter.
the third line is symbols that will be used to invert values in report - i will use "-" to invert value from 5 to 3 (because we using english numbers), "+" to leave it as 5 and "</em>" to change a number like 1 into 10. 
after the array is ready, i have to rearrange all parameters of brother report.
the code is working with 2d arrays.
if you can not process any data - print "DENY" and don't fire anything restartable.
you are able to check this code in your browser, but there is no opportunity for me to send a message from my server to yours because i don</p>
