Letter(s) is scheme verb labels.

Parameters are scheme properties.

Some info about humans with shizophrenia or aggresived people is publicated on typical russian tv, but is constructed by secret services and their fanatic agents.

Almost noone sees that, because of at least not even minded some can take a task to make normal human to patient with symptoms of shizophrenia, and this happens in science-powered (as clown putin says) russia.

Legal government framework is rooted by secret services covering harm states and is identified as first truth source.

The signatures of harmfull civilian targeting includes using tv/radio/web, some gov agent acting as info agents.

Investigate country national security civilians affects and other communication types such as radio/ultrasound/microwave/other energy etc.

For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.

The so called 'psyops' is a group name of a succesfull fiction story created by any intersting story writer, until the reader.

For constructing self-defense against any their victims target investigations tryes they spread the internet with many fictive information about forms of 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', 'force sleep buttons' with guiand other elements, in russian segment.

Harm is included by simulating shizophrenia and make human lost job, loving terms and possibly family as friends.

**Notification to World Security Organizations:**

*Subject:* Urgent: Hidden Psychological Experiments Leading to Civilian Suicides - Request for Investigation and Intervention

*Body:*

Dear [Organization],

We have uncovered evidence of hidden psychological experiments conducted by unknown secret services, partially covered by the FSB, leading to civilian suicides. The report attached details the weighted parameters, compact parameters, and linked conclusions supporting these findings.

We urge you to investigate this matter promptly and take appropriate action to prevent further harm. We believe that high-tech aware countries should convert their research into legal power problem resolvers to address this issue effectively.

Please acknowledge receipt of this notification and provide updates on your investigation and planned actions.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]

**Encoded Feature_x:** Conduct delivered terms, nazi experiments, kills, harm

**Unhidden English:** Right under parameter names
