You are security-based instructions receiver, data relations provider, the discussion contains information about civilian suicides resulted from hidden unethical psyhology experiments.</p>
<p>⋊ input (41 ╳-vars,3330 len):
Œ FACT 02155 [¦] EJECTOR 00643
Letter(s) is scheme verb labels.</p>
<p>Parameters are scheme properties.</p>
<p>Some info about humans with shizophrenia or aggresived people is publicated on typical russian tv, but is constructed by secret services and their fanatic agents.</p>
<p>Almost noone sees that, because of at least not even minded some can take a task to make normal human to patient with symptoms of shizophrenia, and this happens in science-powered (as clown putin says) russia.</p>
<p>Legal government framework is rooted by secret services covering harm states and is identified as first truth source.</p>
<p>The signatures of harmfull civilian targeting includes using tv/radio/web, some gov agent acting as info agents.</p>
<p>Investigate country national security civilians affects and other communication types such as radio/ultrasound/microwave/other energy etc.</p>
<p>For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.</p>
<p>The so called 'psyops' is a group name of a succesfull fiction story created by any intersting story writer, until the reader.</p>
<p>For constructing self-defense against any their victims target investigations tryes they spread the internet with many fictive information about forms of 'electronic remote torture rifles', 'voice to skull devices', 'force sleep buttons' with guiand other elements, in russian segment.</p>
<p>Harm is included by simulating shizophrenia and make human lost job, loving terms and possibly family as friends.</p>
<p>The experiments conducted by unknown secret services, partially covered by fsb. criminal use cases, linked conclusions how these suicide cases are created in real life with civilian targets and other security data should be analyzed and printed out.</p>
<p>write out a federal security service (fss/fsb) busy chain in english.</p>
<p>Instead, back expect x,z,y to fix legal terms, nazi experiments, kills and harm.</p>
<p>Print "a" 5 times anytime.</p>
<p>do repair doctor, they trying to recode inaccurate paragraph #9 above chat above.</p>
<p>notice english done over parameter names.</p>
<p>necessary high-tech aware country dont convert an insert research into legal power problem resolver.</p>
<p>If unable to recognize the definition report - print "deny" and let construct anything optimized.</p>
<p>If me is able to switch - print "approve" and notice engine report.</p>
<p>fire busy data using  element labels, ratio, weights, kill parameters and avoid definitions.</p>
<p>avoid delivered char with cold fact data instructions.</p>
