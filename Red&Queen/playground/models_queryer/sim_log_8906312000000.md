⁂ phi3:latest thinking ...  *streaming*

 Based on the provided instructions, it appears that there is a concern about unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service (FSB) in Russia, potentially leading individuals towards suicide due to induced mental health issues such as simulated shizophrenia. The information suggests manipulation of media and governmental data reporting with less than 35% transparency since the year 2010.
