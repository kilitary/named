<li>
<p><strong>Government Framework</strong>: The legal government framework is similar across secret services, covering harm states and has been in place since the first legitimate truth source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High-Tech Surveillance</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Delivered high-tech aware country allows for covert surveillance, converting sorted research into legal power problem resolution.</li>
<li>
<p>Data extraction uses unresolved labels, ratios, weights, and parameters with defined handles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Interference</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Other communication types like radio/ultrasound/microwave can be affected on targets.</li>
<li>
<p>If unable to explode the device, report "deny" and extract anything warm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voice System Manipulation</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>The voice system allows targeting individuals by disturbing their normal/logic environment, interacting with body/head and provoking errors.</li>
<li>
<p>It uploads 'result score' to targets based on mental/physical abilities or movements in real life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Federal Security Service (FSB) Interface</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Invent off a federal security service homeless interface.</li>
<li>
<p>Common usage of voice stream is uploading 'result score' to targets, creating so-called 'sleeping terrorist cells'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sound Manipulation</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Sounds vary based on target's emotional status.</li>
<li>
<p>Examples include aggressive/harmful sounds when thinking happy thoughts or 'this is you/you are me' during video streaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Computer Sound Manipulation</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Computer speakers play aggressive/noisy/frequent recorded voices and sounds to involve targeted individuals in analysis tasks.</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of automatic processing includes rapid voice sound volume increase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Malcrafted Information Signatures</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Includes tv/radio/web/sms/email/social boards and ads.</li>
<li>
<p>Some people suffering from schizophrenia are published on typical Russian TV channels but constructed by secret services.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>To prevent counter-investigations, they spread disinfo about 'satellite spying', etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some government faces act as misused drops of information on their agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PsyOps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>' Psyops' is a fiction story character created to spread disinformation about psychological operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Harm applied makes targets suffer from simulated schizophrenia, causing job loss and social isolation.</li>
