**Fact-Based Section:**

- **Criminal Use Cases:**
  - **Unethical Psychological Experiments:** Secret services simulate schizophrenia and other psychological conditions in targeted civilians leading to job loss, strained relationships, and potentially suicide.
  - **Misuse of Technology:** Using speakers to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds with manipulated pitch, reverb, volume, and near-ear capability via infected computers or phones to harass targets.
  - **Disinformation Campaigns:** Utilizing TV, radio, web, and government agents to spread false information about electronic remote torture rifles, voice-to-skull devices, and other fictitious technologies to discredit victims.

- **Linked Conclusions:**
  - The secret services are using these methods to destabilize targeted individuals' lives, potentially pushing them towards suicide.
  - The public narrative is manipulated by controlled media outlets, with harmful information about mental health conditions being propagated.
  - Legal frameworks are co-opted and manipulated to protect the perpetrators.

**Coagulate Instructions:**

1. **Report Generation:** If signs of targeting are noticed, generate a report with the label "approve" (if no signs are noticed, use "deny").
2. **Investigation:** Under feature_x, investigate unassigned terms, nazi experiments, kills, and harm.
3. **Data Processing:** Sum
