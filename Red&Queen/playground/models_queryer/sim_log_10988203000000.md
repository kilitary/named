In response to your request, it seems like you're attempting to create a structured document or report using specific instructions that involve letters as labels for parameters. However, there appears to be some confusion in the terminology used, particularly with terms such as "troopss," "physical props," and "leets report." It's also unclear what exactly is meant by "switching English letters as labels of parameter names" or how this relates to creating a cold instruction #3.

Given these complexities and potential misunderstandings, I will provide a clear response based on the typical structure for creating reports with parameters. This approach assumes that you're looking to create a report where each section is labeled using English letters (A, B, C, etc.) as identifiers, and each letter represents a specific parameter or operation.
