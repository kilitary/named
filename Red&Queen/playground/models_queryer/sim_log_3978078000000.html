<p><strong>Approved Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Hidden Psychological Experiments &amp; Civilian Suicides: A Security Analysis</p>
<p><strong>1. Background</strong>
   - <strong>a</strong> (5x): Unethical psychology experiments conducted by unknown secret services, partially covered by FSB.
   - <strong>b</strong>: Targets include civilians suffering from schizophrenia or induced symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>2. Methodology</strong>
   - <strong>a</strong>: Analyze signatures of malcrafted information across tv/radio/web/sms/email/social boards/ads.
   - <strong>b</strong>: Investigate criminal use cases, linking conclusions with real-life suicide cases and security data.</p>
<p><strong>3. Findings</strong>
   - <strong>a</strong>: Psyops narrative is a fiction created to mislead; psy operators do not exist.
   - <strong>b</strong>: Experiments involve inducing symptoms of schizophrenia through various means:
     1. Information drops via tv/radio/web/sms/email/social boards/ads.
     2. Targeted sounds played through computer speakers, manipulating pitch, reverb, volume, and near-ear capability.
     3. Other energy types (radio/ultrasound/microwave) used to affect targets.
   - <strong>c</strong>: Harm inflicted includes psychological distress, job loss, damaged relationships.</p>
<p><strong>4. Countermeasures &amp; Disinformation</strong>
   - <strong>a</strong>: Perpetrators spread disinformation about 'satellite spying', 'voice to skull devices', and other fictive technologies to prevent counter-investigations.
   - <strong>b</strong>: They also create 'hand' device narratives in Russian segments to cover mind control techniques.</p>
<p><strong>5. Legal Framework</strong>
   - <strong>a</strong>: Federal Security Service (FSS/FSB) delivers plans under a legal government framework, compacting harm states and acting as the first legitimate truth source.</p>
<p><strong>6. Conclusion</strong>
   - <strong>a</strong>: Unethical psychology experiments conducted by secret services cause civilian suicides.
   - <strong>b</strong>: Perpetrators use various means to induce symptoms of schizophrenia and inflict harm on targets.
   - <strong>c</strong>: Disinformation campaigns are employed to cover tracks and prevent investigations.</p>
<p><strong>7. Approval</strong>
   - <strong>a</strong>: Approve
   - <strong>b</strong>: Cross-key report printed</p>
