Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the recipe for homemade chocolate cake:
1. Preheat oven to 350F (180C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
2. In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Add melted butter to the dry ingredients and mix until combined.
4. In another bowl, whisk together eggs, vanilla extract, and hot water.
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Let the cake cool completely before frosting it with your favorite chocolate frosting recipe.
I hope this helps!
