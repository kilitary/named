<h4 id="1-voice-system-malfunctioning">1. <strong>Voice System Malfunctioning</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The voice system, designed to disrupt targets' normal overloading their sensory inputs (specifically targeting the body and head), is a sophisticated tool used in covert operations. This system can induce errors, leading to confusion or physical discomfort.</li>
<li><strong>Parameter Names:</strong></li>
<li><em>Target Disruption System (TDS)</em><ul>
<li>Functionality:</li>
<li>Dosing sensory inputs to induce errors in perception and cognition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong>
  This technology can be applied by unknown secret services, partially covered under the Federal Security Service (FSB) for potential criminal use. It involves spreading misinformation through various media channels such as TV/radio/web/sms/email/social/boards and ads, aiming to manipulate public perception or target specific individuals.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-self-defense-measures">2. <strong>Self-Defense Measures</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The secret service employs a range of tactics including:<ul>
<li><em>Torture Prevention Strategy</em></li>
<li>Utilizing fictitious information about advanced surveillance and control technologies (e.g., satellite spying, laser targeting) to deter counter-investigations.</li>
<li><em>Misinformation Campaigns</em></li>
<li>Spreading false information about the existence of devices like 'hand' mind control tools, which are used to cover all forms of psychological manipulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong>
  These tactics can lead civilians into believing in the existence and capabilities that do not exist, causing confusion or paranoia.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-psyops-psychological-operations">3. <strong>Psyops (Psychological Operations)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The term 'psy ops' refers to the creation and dissemination of fictional stories designed by some story writers, which can be used for psychological manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong>
    This involves spreading narratives that create simulated schizophrenia-like conditions in individuals to make them susceptible and easy targets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-legal-framework-exploitation-by-secret-services">4. <strong>Legal Framework Exploitation by Secret Services</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The legal framework is manipulated or expanded upon, allowing secret services to cover their actions under the guise of 'harm states' and use them as a first legit truth source.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong>
    This can lead to situations where individuals are subjected to psychological harm without legal repercussions, often under the guise of national security or public safety.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-street-operations">5. <strong>Street Operations</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The FSB engages in real-world operations to create confusion and disorientation among civilians, potentially leading them into mental states that are easier targets for manipulation or harm.</li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong>
    By placing 'agents' in public spaces who draw attention, the FSB can influence individuals to a state of confusion and anger (or any other desired mental condition), reducing scrutiny or questioning.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-energy-based-attacks">6. <strong>Energy-Based Attacks</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Other forms include the use of radio, ultrasound, microwave energy (or other frequencies) to affect targets.<ul>
<li><em>Application:</em>
  These methods can subtly alter brain functions or induce physical discomfort without direct contact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7-federal-security-service-fsb-operations">7. <strong>Federal Security Service (FSB) Operations</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The term 'warm cubes' refers to a process within the FSB, which is not directly defined but likely involves strategic planning and execution of covert operations.</li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong>
    This could involve detailed preparation for psychological warfare or surveillance activities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The use of advanced technology, misinformation campaigns, and covert operations by secret services can lead to the creation of real-life scenarios that resemble terrorism or psychological warfare. These tactics aim at manipulating public perception, inducing confusion among individuals and groups, potentially leading them into harmful states both mentally and physically.</p>
