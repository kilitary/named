**Coagulated Data and Analysis:**

1. **Criminal Use Cases:**
   - **Psychological Manipulation:** Secret services are using psychological manipulation techniques, possibly including subliminal messaging via various media (TV, radio, web), to induce symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression in targeted civilians.
   - **Electronic Harassment:** Targeted individuals' computers and phones may be used to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and sounds, with varying pitch, reverb, volume, and near-ear capability, aiming to provoke stress and analysis paralysis.
   - **Surveillance and Data Collection:** Targeted individuals are likely under constant surveillance. Their actions, reactions, and even conversations may be recorded and analyzed using advanced technologies like military-grade Wi-Fi/Bluetooth scans.

2. **How Suicide Cases Are Made Real:**
   - **Isolation:** Victims may lose their jobs, relationships, and social support due to perceived erratic behavior caused by the manipulation, leading to isolation and despair.
   - **Gaslighting:** Secret services may manipulate information and evidence to make victims appear mentally unstable or dangerous in the eyes of others, further isolating them.
   - **Direct Influence:** Manipulation techniques could potentially directly influence victims' thoughts and emotions, pushing them towards self-harm or suicide.

3. **Notifications to World Security Organizations:**

   **To: Interpol, UN Human Rights Office, NATO Intelligence Division**

   Subject: Urgent Investigation into Alleged Secret Service Psychological Warfare Operations in Russia

   1. **Background:** Reports suggest that secret services in Russia are conducting unethical psychology experiments on civilians, potentially leading to suicides.
