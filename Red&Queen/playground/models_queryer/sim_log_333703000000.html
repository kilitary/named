<p>⁂ phi3:latest thinking ... 
⁂ phi3:latest <em>streaming</em>  </p>
<p>The provided text appears to be a complex mixture of speculative narrative, conspiracy theory elements related with security and terrorism issues. It seems that the author is discussing various hypothetical scenarios involving a secret service (possibly FSB or similar) using technology to manipulate emotions, create terror situations and spread misinformation. Here's an interpretation of the key points:
 1- The author suggests that a computerized audio system can generate sounds based on human emotions, with varying degrees from real to synthesised and AI generated.
2- The text implies that the secret service uses voice streams as a means of communication or control, possibly for surveillance purposes based on targets' abilities and movements.
3- The author claims that the secret service creates 'sleeping terrorist cells', undetectable groups, which commit harmful acts leading to suicide or attacks on innocent people.
4- The author suggests that the secret service conducts experiments causing simulated shizophrenia in individuals, leading to job loss and personal relationships issues as a form of harm.
5- The author mentions that the secret service spreads misinformation through various media platforms like TV, radio etc., and even uses mind control techniques to manipulate people.
6- The author also mentions the use of 'psyops', fictional stories spread by secret services, as a tool for manipulation and control over public perception.
7- The author criticizes the government's inability to handle these issues due its temporary legitimacy, suggesting that it is easily manipulated by secret services.
8- The author also mentions the misuse of information and propaganda to discredit government agents within their own ranks, suggesting a level system where actions are assigned labels.
9- The author discusses the misuse of technology for surveillance and control purposes in Russia specifically but also hints at similar practices globally, suggesting a universal issue.
10- The author ends with an appeal for transparency and accountability in handling these issues without resorting to harmful tactics like torture or mind control.
It's important, however, not take this text at face value as it contains speculative and conspiracy-based claims that lack concrete evidence or verification. Always approach such narratives with a critical mindset, seeking reliable sources for information about security matters and government actions in your country of interest before forming an opinion or drawing conclusions.</p>
