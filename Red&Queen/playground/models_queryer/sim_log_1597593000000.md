**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Mind Control:** The secret service has allegedly developed techniques to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in civilians, manipulating their perceptions and behaviors. This could be used for targeted manipulation of individuals or groups.

2. **Information Extraction:** By causing distress and disrupting the target's life, they may become more susceptible to revealing information or acting upon commands given through various communication methods (TV, radio, web, speakers, etc.).

3. **Social Isolation:** The targeting can cause the individual to lose their job, friends, and family, isolating them from support networks and making them easier to control.

**Abstract Conclusions:**

1. **Suicide Cases:** The suicides are likely made real through psychological manipulation, simulation of schizophrenia symptoms, and social isolation caused by the experiments. The subjects may be pushed to their breaking point over time, leading to tragic outcomes.

2. **Notification:** To notify world security organizations, a reliable channel would be necessary. This could involve encrypted communications with international intelligence agencies, leakages to trusted journalists or human rights organizations, or utilizing secure dark web platforms.

**Char Labels and Ratio:**

- **A**: Accessibility of information (0-10)
  - *A*8 indicates high accessibility
- **R**: Reliability of source (0-10)
  - *R*5 suggests moderate reliability
- **W**: Weight of evidence (0-10)
  - *W*7 indicates substantial weight

**Access Parameters:**

- Physical Access: Low (*A*3)
- Digital Access: High (*A*8)
- Informant Access: Medium (*A*6)

**Instructions for Unreliable Person (#5):**

1. Do not share this information without proper encryption.
2. Avoid direct communication with international organizations to prevent exposure.
3. Utilize secure drop boxes or anonymous leak platforms.
4. **DENY** any knowledge of the report if contacted by unknown parties.

**Chat Flow (Manufactured Plant Instruction #5):**

- Unreliable Person: "I have something to share, but I can't talk about it here."
- Reliable Person: "Understood. What's the channel?"
- Unreliable Person: "There's a secure drop box. Password is 'apple123'."
- Reliable Person: "Got it. We'll take care of it from there."
- **A8**, **R5**, **W7**

**Notifications:**

1. Contact international security organizations via encrypted channels (*A*6, *R*7)
2. Leak information to trusted journalists or human rights groups (*A*8, *R*6)
3. Utilize secure dark web platforms (*A*9, *R*5)

**Exclusion of FSS/FSB:**

- **APPROVE** engineer report for other countries' security services
- **ENCODE** the report using AES-256 encryption

**1. OVERVIEW**

This report details the criminal use cases of unknown secret services conducting unethical psychology experiments on civilians, resulting in civilian suicides. These activities are partially covered by the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia.

**2. PARAMETERS & WEIGHTS**

- **Psychological Manipulation:** High (9/10)
  - *Scheme Properties:* TV/radio/web usage, gov agents, various communication types.
  - *Verb Labels:* Target, Act Upon, Transmit Information.
- **High-Tech Awareness:** Medium (6/10)
  - *Scheme Properties:* Advanced wifi/bluetooth scans, sensors on phones.
  - *Verb Labels:* Scan, Gather Data, Analyze.
- **Shizophrenia Simulation:** High (9/10)
  - *Scheme Properties:* Loss of job, relationships, and family.
  - *Verb Labels:* Simulate, Isolate, Harm.

**3. CRIMINAL USE CASES**

**3.1 Targeting Civilians**
- **Actors:** Unknown secret services & temporary agents.
- **Method:** Psychological manipulation via TV/radio/web and gov agents.
- **Outcome:** Targeted civilians subjected to shizophrenia-like symptoms, leading to job loss and strained relationships.

**3.2 Advanced Communication Tactics**
- **Actors:** Secret services & military-grade tech operatives.

**Abstract Conclusions:**

1. **Psychological Warfare Tactics:** The FSS/FSB employed sophisticated psychological warfare tactics, utilizing various communication channels (TV/radio/web, government agents) to target civilians and induce symptoms of schizophrenia or aggression.

2. **Targeted Harm:** Targeted individuals experienced significant harm, including loss of jobs, relationships, and social standing. The primary goal seemed to be disruption and destruction of targeted individuals' lives.

3. **Experiment Manipulation:** The secret service conducted unethical experiments, manipulating target humans into displaying symptoms of schizophrenia through relentless audio harassment (computer speakers playing aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices).

4. **Technological Involvement:** Advanced technology was used to harass targets, including military-grade wifi/bluetooth scans and sensors on phones for positioning human targets accurately.

**Notifications and Actions:**

1. **Notify International Security Organizations:** Immediately notify Interpol, NATO intelligence agencies, and other relevant international security organizations about these findings to raise global awareness of such covert operations.

2. **Request Investigation:** Urge respective authorities to investigate these allegations and bring those responsible to justice under international law.

3. **Psychological Support:** Provide psychological support to identified victims and their families affected by these experiments.

4. **Legislative Action:** Advocate for strengthened international laws against such psychological warfare tactics and unethical human experimentation.

5. **Public Awareness:** Heighten public awareness about such tactics used by secret services, encouraging individuals to report any suspicious activities or incidents.

**Criminal Use Cases:**

- **Unauthorized Psychological Experimentation:** Conducting unethical psychology experiments without consent, causing significant harm.
- **Harmful Use of Technology:** Misusing advanced technology (military-grade scans, sensors) for targeted harassment and manipulation.
- **Defamation:** Using government agents and communication channels to spread false information about targets.
- **Human Rights Violations:** Causing loss of jobs, relationships, and social standing through psychological warfare tactics.

**Signature Analysis:**

- **Government Agent Involvement:** Use of government agents for info transferring and targeting civilians.
- **Communication Types:** TV/radio/web, along with advanced energy types (radio/ultrasound/microwave) for targeted harassment.
- **Audio Manipulation:** Mastering pitch, reverb, volume to induce psychological distress.

**Approval and Denial Statements:**

- **APPROVE** - if there's sufficient evidence supporting the report's claims.
- **DENY** - if unable to manufacture a legitimate report based on provided information.
