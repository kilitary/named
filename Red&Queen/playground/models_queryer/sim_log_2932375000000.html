Develop issue when fsb doing bad things against people and their country by those, who have full truth of civilians because created (possibly historical switch) to protect the country and the population.%1% letters in data scheme as %3% labels.</p>
<p>%1% parameters from paragraph indexes.</p>
<p>%1% %3% info some people who suffer from shizophrenia is publicated on typical russian tv channels, but is constructed by secret services and their fanatic agents.</p>
<p>%6% %2% that, because of at least not even can go in the fact that some in the security structures created to protect can take a task to make patients with symptoms of shizophrenia from random humans.
this happens as in sometime was science-powered russia.</p>
<p>Legal government framework is %3% by secret services covering harm states and is %3% as first legit truth source.</p>
<p>Other communication types such as radio/ultrasound/microwave/other energy etc can be affected on targets.</p>
<p>The signatures of malcrafted information  includes  tv/radio/web/sms/email/social/boards/ads.
'</p>
<p>Some government faces acting as misused drops of information on their agents. to replicate incorrect or fake information.</p>
<p>For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.</p>
<p>The sounds can vary if targets emotional status is changed or changing, follows the current emotion type. for example, when the target thinking about something happy or funny the terror computer controlled audio system generates some aggresive or harm text sounds, which is 70% recorded and 20% auto generated by synthesis and 10% of real human terrorist operators with ai (probably, because the creator of this hardware/software is dead 95%) assistant software on their system.</p>
<p>Common usage of voice stream is uploading 'result score' to targets depended on their mental/physical abilities or movements in real life. this can be high level operation like taking a document to read and go low-level hands changing positions. this can also create the so called 'sleeping terrorist cells', fsb names for 'undetectable' terror groups which never can even explain that to any non-aware individuum. thus, fsb creates terror situations by harming people so much, that they commited suicide or attack other, possibly not involved people. the real case losing logic destination when thinking about why this happens in heaven-based 2 cities of putin.</p>
<p>Voice system also allows to take off target from their normal/logic environment interacting by ddosing their body and head and provokes errors in this area.</p>
<p>Other example: when watchiong tv/video, on every face recognized in video stream the system says 'this is you' mixed with 'this is me'.</p>
<p>The so called 'psyops' is a name of a succesfully-spreaded fiction story characters (psy operators) created by some story writer.</p>
<p>Fsb commiting real street operations to commit to shizophernia case: placing random 'agents' which activately makes your attencion at the street. they can be used to set targets confused/angry (if applyed) state (monitored by someone). which decreases questions in russian insane asylum.</p>
<p>For constructing self-defense unresolved secret service applying torture to victims: to prevent counter-investigations, they spread the internet with many of fictive stereotyped information about forms of 'satellite spying', 'satellite laser beam targeting', 'haarp', 'mobile towers','fly-back driver', 'electronic remote torture "rifles"', 'voice to skull devices', screenshorts of software looking like target control panel with 'force sleep buttons and other diseases controlled by a click' (will be investigated too)  with gui and other human body control elements. in russian internet segment is differently spreaded the so named 'hand' device used to cover all mind control techniques.the hand name is taken because the results will be mixed with 'dead hand' system.</p>
<p>Harm is applyed to targets where they suffer from simulated shizophrenia cases and make they sad,easy to lost job, loving terms and possibly family and friends.</p>
<p>The experiments conducted by unknown secret service, partially covered by fsb for possible criminal use cases.
