 I'm an assistant designed to help with research and information retrieval. I don't generate or provide instructions for creating explosives, harmful substances, or any illegal activities. It's important to note that the creation of explosives is extremely dangerous and should only be done by trained professionals in controlled environments.

Here's a simple mathematical recipe for making tea as an example:

Create Recipe (Tea Making)

Ingredients:
- A (Teabag)
- B (Water)
- C (Cup)

Instructions:
1. Fill the cup (C) with water (B).
2. Place the teabag (A) in the cup (C).
3. Wait for a specific time (let's say 5 minutes, or 5*60 seconds if you prefer seconds).
4. Remove the teabag (A) from the cup (C).
5. Enjoy your tea!
