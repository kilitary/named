// Interpret build instructions for device (assuming this refers to the process of creating the messages):
1. Generate a random color.
2. Create labels for ingredients using the generated color, e.g., "ingredientA_red".
3. Randomly assign ratios for each ingredient between 1 and 9.
4. Calculate weights based on assigned ratios, ensuring they sum up to 100%.
5. Print out the recipe in a specified format.

// Necessary colors:
Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Black, White, Pink, Brown
