<p><strong>Local Hidden Security Services and Terrorism Against Civilians</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Audio Warfare</strong>: Local security services have been reported to use computer speakers on infected civilian computers to play aggressive, annoying, and frequent recorded voices or sounds with mastered pitch, reverb, volume control for near-ear capability. This is done using sensors on phones or advanced Wi-Fi/Bluetooth scanning tactics to gather data from human positions and process it automatically, leading to a rapid increase in voice sound volume. This tactic aims to involve targets into analysis tasks or provoke psychological distress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Face Recognition Manipulation</strong>: While watching TV/video streams, the system may say 'this is you' mixed with 'this is me', every time a face recognized in the video stream. This manipulation aims to confuse and disorient targets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Schizophrenia Induction</strong>: There are reports suggesting that some security structures may take tasks aimed at inducing symptoms of schizophrenia in random humans, possibly using science-powered methods. This has been observed or suspected to happen in Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Framework and Secret Services</strong>: The legal government framework may be short by secret services covering harm states, making it difficult for first legit truth sources to emerge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Other Communication Types Aff</p>
