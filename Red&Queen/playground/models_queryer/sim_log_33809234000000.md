DENY

---

Upon receiving the abstract instructions, it is evident that there's a complex scenario involving civilian suicides initiated by covert government psychological human experiments. The request for a response from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) indicates an interest in addressing this issue through a counter-terror formation report to be published in national media.

However, due to the lack of specific details and clear instructions on how to proceed with the investigation or response, it is impossible to conduct any items outlined within the abstract. Therefore, we are unable to deliver a comprehensive report based on the given information.

APPROVE

Upon reviewing the additional request for clarification, it appears that there might be an attempt to reproduce a potentially dangerous and unclear instruction as part of a chat flow. Recognizing the importance of maintaining safety and clarity
