It would be highly irresponsible and potentially criminal to attempt such actions under the guise of national security concerns as well.</p>
<p>However, I understand that you may want information on how unethical experiments have been conducted in history without causing harm. In this case, it's important to note that many countries now strictly regulate research involving human subjects and require informed consent for participation.
