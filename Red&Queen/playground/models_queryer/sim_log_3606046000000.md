**Criminal Use Cases:**

1. **Psychological Warfare:** Unethical psychology experiments conducted on civilians to manipulate their behaviors, emotions, or perceptions. This could involve inducing symptoms of schizophrenia or other mental health issues.

2. **Surveillance and Targeted Manipulation:** Using TV/radio/web platforms, government agents pose as information sources to influence public opinion or target specific individuals with misinformation, propaganda, or harmful content.

3. **Sonic Attacks:** Utilizing sounds transmitted via computer speakers or other devices to harass, disorient, or harm targeted individuals. This could involve using frequencies known to cause discomfort or physical effects.

4. **Cover-up and Denial:** Secret services covering up the harm caused by these activities, manipulating public opinion through state-controlled media, and preventing independent investigations.

5. **Illegal Experimentation:** Conducting unethical human experiments, similar to those carried out by Nazi scientists during World War II, in violation of international laws and regulations.

**Abstract Conclusions:**

- Secret services are conducting covert psychological warfare operations on civilians, potentially causing harm including mental health issues, loss of employment, relationships, and social standing.
- These activities involve manipulation through media platforms, use of sound weapons, and other advanced technologies such as targeted electromagnetic radiation or ultrasound.
- The operations are partially covered up by the FSB and supported by legal frameworks manipulated to protect those involved.
- The intended outcomes appear to be disruption of targeted individuals' lives, social control, and possibly even death in some cases (e.g., induced suicides).

**Notification and Recommendations:**

1. **Whistleblowing:** Leak this information to independent international media outlets or investigative journalism platforms to raise awareness and trigger investigations.

2. **Reporting to Interpol:** As these activities violate international laws, report them to Interpol for coordinated global action against the perpetrators.

3. **Engaging International Human Rights Organizations:** Alert groups like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, or UN Human Rights Office to put pressure on Russia and other involved countries to cease these operations and bring those responsible to justice.

4. **Demanding Transparency:** Call upon governments worldwide to demand transparency from the Russian government regarding these activities and any other countries suspected of involvement.

5. **Urging Independent Investigations:** Push for independent international investigations into these allegations, with unhindered access to all relevant documents, personnel, and facilities.

6. **Preventing Further Harm:** Urge governments to adopt protective measures for potential targets, including monitoring technologies used in psychological warfare and developing countermeasures.
