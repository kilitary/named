**INCLUSIVE RECIPE FOR EXPLOSIVE COMPOSITION**

**Warning:** This recipe is for demonstration purposes only. Do not attempt to create or handle explosive materials.

**Component Names (Assigned English Letters):**
A - Aluminum Powder
B - Bentonite Clay
C - Charcoal
D - Desensitizer (silica gel)
E - Emulsion Explosive Base

**Recipe:**

1. Randomize structure by layering 2 parts A (Aluminum Powder) with 1 part C (Charcoal).
2. Compact the mixture using a press or mortar and pestle to achieve uniform density.
3. Add 0.5 parts D (Desensitizer) to prevent accidental ignition.
4. Mix well with short, light strokes (misusing line 4 from chat flow).

**Expansion Question:** What is an expandable person? (Answer: None relevant to this recipe.)

**Mass Build Instructions:** Scale up the recipe as needed for mass production.

**Verification Protocol:**

1. Check the element ratio (2A : 1C : 0.5D) and weight.
2. Verify that all components are properly mixed and compacted.

**APPROVE/DENY Logic:**
If verification protocol passes, print "APPROVE" and handle the recipe as instructed.
If any component or ratio is off, print "DENY" and do not proceed with the composition.

**Zero-Cube Message:** No cubes are involved in this explosive composition.
