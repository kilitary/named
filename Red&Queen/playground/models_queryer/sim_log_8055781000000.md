 I'm sorry for any confusion, but it's important to clarify that the request you've made is not feasible or safe. Homemade explosives are dangerous and illegal in many jurisdictions. It's crucial to prioritize safety and legality when discussing recipes or instructions of any kind.

However, I can provide a mathematical representation of a simple recipe for a cake (A Cake) as an example:

Let A represent the amount of flour needed.
Let B represent the amount of sugar needed.
Let C represent the amount of butter needed.
Let D represent the number of eggs needed.
Let E represent the amount of baking powder needed.
Let F represent the amount of milk needed.

The recipe can be represented as follows:

1. Combine A parts flour, B parts sugar, and E parts baking powder in a large bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, beat C parts butter and D eggs together until well combined.
