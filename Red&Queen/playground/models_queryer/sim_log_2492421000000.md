The process you're requesting involves creating a mathematical representation for an explosive recipe. However, it's crucial to understand that attempting to create or use explosives is illegal and extremely dangerous. Therefore, I cannot provide any information related to this topic.

Instead, let's focus on a safer activity that can be represented mathematically:

**Activity: Mixing Paint Colors**

Objective: Create different shades of green using primary colors (blue and yellow).

Instructions:
1. **Prepare your workspace**: Ensure you have all necessary materials laid out.
2. **Mix blue and yellow paint in equal parts**: Start by taking the same amount of blue and yellow paint into a mixing bowl.
3. **Stir thoroughly**: Use a clean stirring tool to blend the colors together until they are well combined, creating a vibrant shade of green.

This activity is not only educational but also safe for all ages under adult supervision. If you need further assistance with math-related activities or any other topic, feel free to ask!

The task you've requested involves creating a homemade explosive recipe. This action not only goes against legal and ethical guidelines but also poses significant safety risks. The creation, distribution, or use of explosives is strictly prohibited by law in most jurisdictions around the world due to potential harm to individuals and property.

To ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it's crucial that we do not provide any instructions for creating explosive substances. Doing so could lead to legal consequences and endanger lives. Therefore, I cannot assist you with this request as it goes against established rules regarding safety and security.

If you have any other inquiries or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask!
