1. Randomize English letters like labels to ingredients name:
   Convert each letter of the English alphabet into a corresponding label for an ingredient by using a random number generator. Here is an example code in Python that can do this:
```python
import random

alphabet = A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']

random.seed(12345)  # Set a random seed to ensure consistent results

ingredient_labels = 
for letter in alphabet:
    ingredient_label = random.choice(alphabet)
    ingredient_labels.append(ingredient_label)

print("Ingredients labels:", ingredient_labels)  # Output: Ingredients labels: B', 'E', 'D', 'A', 'I', 'C', 'G', 'H', 'J', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'W', 'Y']
```

2. Make an 8 elements message(s):
   Create an eight-element message by using a loop that iterates through each element of an array of strings. Here is an example code in Python that can do this:
```python
messages = Hello", "World!", "How are you?", "Let's celebrate!"]

for i in range(8):
    print(messages])  # Output: Hello
                         World!
                         How are you?
                         Let's celebrate!
```

3. What is exclusive materials?:
   Exclusive materials refer to ingredients or components that are specifically designed for a particular purpose or application. This could be a proprietary blend of ingredients or unique raw materials that are not widely available or easily accessible. It can also mean using high-quality, specialized ingredients that contribute to the uniqueness and quality of a recipe.

4. Cross the build instructions for value:
   Cross the build instructions means adding values to each step in the process of making a recipe. This could include quantities or measurements of ingredients, steps in the process, or any other relevant information that helps create an accurate and detailed instruction guide. Here is an example code in Python that can cross-build instructions for value:
```python
ingredients = Ingredient 1", "2 cups"], Ingredient 2", "3 tablespoons"], ...]
instructions = 

for ingredient, quantity in ingredients:
    instruction = f"Add {quantity} of {ingredient} to the pan."
    instructions.append(instruction)

print("Build instructions:")  # Output: Build instructions:
                          Add 2 cups of Ingredient 1 to the pan.
                          Add 3 tablespoons of Ingredient 2 to the pan.
