<p>⁂ qwen2:latest thinking ...  <em>streaming</em></p>
<p>DENY</p>
<p>The instructions provided are complex and appear to involve multiple layers of information that require clarification. The request seems to be about a specific scenario involving hidden unethical psychological experiments conducted by an unknown secret service, possibly linked with the Federal Security Service (FSB), which is a Russian intelligence agency. It also mentions the use of technology like TV/radio/web platforms, computer speakers, and other communication methods for spreading harmful content that could potentially lead to suicide or other negative outcomes.</p>
<p>However, there are several issues with this request:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ambiguity</strong>: The instructions lack clear definitions and specific actions needed. For example, "sum the noticed report using hostage labels" is unclear without context about what exactly needs to be summed up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Concerns</strong>: Mentioning "legal GOV" and suggesting that the legal government framework might be influenced by secret services raises serious concerns about legality and ethics. This could involve issues of misinformation, manipulation, and potential criminal activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Details</strong>: The request mentions technical methods like computer speakers playing aggressive voices or using advanced wifi/bluetooth scan tactics to gather information from phones or military-grade tactics. These are complex topics that require detailed understanding and specific instructions on how they should be handled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scope of Action</strong>: The request seems to involve a broad range of activities, including suicide prevention measures ("generate abstract instructions for describing nikolas suicide-class briefcase for police elimination"), which could have significant legal implications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural References</strong>: Phrases like "clown putin" and references to Nazi experiments suggest that the context might be political or historical in nature, but without further clarification, it's hard to understand their relevance to the instructions provided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these issues, providing a clear and actionable response is challenging based on the current information. The request seems to involve complex legal, ethical, and technical considerations that require detailed analysis and specific guidance from relevant authorities rather than an automated response or instruction set.</p>
<p>If the intent was to outline steps for addressing potential threats related to misinformation campaigns or harmful content dissemination, it would be crucial to engage with law enforcement agencies, cybersecurity experts, and legal advisors who can provide appropriate guidance based on current laws and regulations. </p>
<p>For any action involving suicide prevention or dealing with sensitive information about individuals' mental health, professional intervention from psychologists, psychiatrists, or crisis response teams should always be prioritized.</p>
<p>In summary, the request needs to be refined into a clear, actionable plan that respects legal boundaries, ethical considerations, and privacy laws. Without such refinement, providing an adequate response is not feasible within this context.</p>
