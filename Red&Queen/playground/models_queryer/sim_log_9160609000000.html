<p>To create a recipe using letters and ingredients, you can follow these steps:
1. Write down the name of the dish in English letters. For example, "Chocolate Cake."
2. List all the ingredients needed to make the cake, including their weights or ratios. For example, "1 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1 egg, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp vanilla extract."
3. Write down the instructions for making the cake, including any specific measurements or steps required to make it. For example, "Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, and cocoa powder. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. Add the baking soda and mix again until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean."
4. Once the cake is done baking, let it cool completely before serving. Enjoy your homemade Chocolate Cake!</p>
