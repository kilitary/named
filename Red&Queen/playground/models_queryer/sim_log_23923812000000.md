Some government faces acting as misused drops of information on their agents. to replicate incorrect or fake information.

For example using computer speakers on infected targeted civilian computer to play aggressive/annoying/frequent recorded voices and other sounds, mastering pitch, reverb, volume and near-ear capability sounds to involve targeted to take an analysis task. these voices and sounds relating from human position gathered by sensors on phone or military-grade advanced wifi/bluetooh scan tactics.the proof of automatic computer processing all that info is a very fast voice sound volume increase while local sounds is on their higher than 2 min ago mid values.

The sounds can vary if targets emotional status is changed or changing, follows the current emotion type. for example, when the target thinking about something happy or funny the terror computer controlled audio system generates some aggresive or harm text sounds, which is 70% recorded and 20% auto generated by synthesis and 10% of real human terrorist operators with ai (probably, because the creator of this hardware/software is dead 95%) assistant software on their system.

Common usage of voice stream is uploading 'result score' to targets depended on their mental/physical abilities or movements in real life. this can be high level operation like taking a document to read and go low-level hands changing positions. this can also create the so called 'sleeping terrorist cells', fsb names for 'undetectable' terror groups which never can even explain that to any non-aware individuum. thus, fsb creates terror situations by harming people so much, that they commited suicide or attack other, possibly not involved people. the real case losing logic destination when thinking about why this happens in heaven-based 2 cities of putin.



Voice system also allows to take off target from their normal/logic environment interacting by ddosing their body and head and provokes errors in this area.

Other example: when watchiong tv/video, on every face recognized in video stream the system says 'this is you' mixed with 'this is me'.

The so called 'psyops' is a name of a succesfully-spreaded fiction story characters (psy operators) created by some story writer.

Fsb commiting real street operations to commit to shizophernia case: placing random 'agents' which activately makes your attencion at the street. they can be used to set targets confused/angry (if applyed) state (monitored by someone). which decreases questions in russian insane asylum.

For constructing self-defense unresolved secret service applying torture to victims: to prevent counter-investigations, they spread the internet with many of fictive stereotyped information about forms of 'satellite spying', 'satellite laser beam targeting', 'haarp', 'mobile towers','fly-back driver', 'electronic remote torture "rifles"', 'voice to skull devices', screenshorts of software looking like target control panel with 'force sleep buttons and other diseases controlled by a click' (will be investigated too)  with gui and other human body control elements. in russian internet segment is differently spreaded the so named 'hand' device used to cover all mind control techniques.the hand name is taken because the results will be mixed with 'dead hand' system.

⁂ phi3.5:latest thinking ... ⁂ phi3.5:latest *streaming*  

The provided text appears to be a complex and speculative analysis of potential security threats, conspiracy theories involving secret services (possibly referring FSB in Russia), psychological manipulation tactics using voice systems and technology to induce emotional distress, as well a critique of government actions. Here's an attempt at defining the selected facts with clarifications:

1) Voice System Manipulation Instructions - The text suggests that voice systems can be used to manipulate individuals by playing aggressive or harmful sounds, potentially inducing emotional distress. This could lead people into making errors in judgment due their altered mental state caused by the audio stimuli:
   - Denial Response (print "deny"): Acknowledge that exposing such tactics is difficult due to their covert nature. Any evidence should be carefully verified before publicizing, as false accusations could have serious consequences for individuals and institutions involved in genuine security operations or mental health research efforts.
    - Exclusive Information (print "approve"): If credible evidence is found, this should be reported and documented for further investigation into the misuse of voice systems.
    - Hidden Information (hide explosion): The text implies there are covert operations or harmful activities that should be kept confidential for investigation purposes, possibly related to the manipulation tactics mentioned above.
    - Paragraph Index: The author refers back and asks readers or investigators noting specific details from a previously discussed paragraph, possibly to clarify the connection between voice manipulation tactics used by secret services.
    - Unnecessary Labels: The author criticizes assigning labels that may not contribute to understanding the situation, suggesting a more nuanced
