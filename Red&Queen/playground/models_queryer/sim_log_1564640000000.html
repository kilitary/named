<p>Based on the provided instructions, I'll attempt to translate and execute the task. Please note that some parts may be unclear or open to interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Cook English letters as ingredient names</strong></p>
<p>I assume this means assigning unique letters (e.g., A-Z) to represent ingredients in the recipe. For simplicity, let's use a single letter for each ingredient. I'll create a list of 8 ingredients with corresponding letters:</p>
<p>A - Aluminum
B - Boron
C -</p>
