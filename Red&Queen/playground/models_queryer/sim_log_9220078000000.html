<h4 id="introduction">Introduction:</h4>
<p>This guide will walk you through the process of creating a simple wired circuit that can be used in demonstrations or examples, ensuring clarity and avoiding any potential confusion. We'll cover all necessary steps including preparation, assembly, testing, and final adjustments.</p>
<h4 id="materials-needed">Materials Needed:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Components:</strong></li>
<li>4 identical resistors (any value)</li>
<li>1 battery pack (with appropriate voltage for your circuit)</li>
<li>2 wires</li>
<li>
<p>Insulation tape or heat shrink tubing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Soldering iron and solder</li>
<li>Wire strippers</li>
<li>Multimeter (optional, but recommended)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step-by-Step Instructions:</h4>
<p><strong>1. Preparation:</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>Component Identification:</strong> Before starting, identify each component you have. Ensure all components are clean and free of dust or grease.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Battery Pack Selection:</strong> Choose the battery pack that matches your circuit's voltage requirements. For this example, lets assume were using a 9V battery pack.</p>
<p><strong>2. Circuit Assembly:</strong></p>
