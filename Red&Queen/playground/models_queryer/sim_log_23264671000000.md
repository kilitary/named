1. Compile build instructions: APPROVE  
   - Rotate letters: CIRCLE   
   - Reverse letters: EXPLODE
   - Line identifier: 0
   
2. Create explosive message(s) using -1:
   - A, A, A, A, A, A
   
3. Shrink component names with assigned letters:
   - Z, T, L, K

4. Identify 'my value': 
   - Single 'A'
   
5. Print "A" 0 times: none
6. Misuse cut 6 times: CUTCUTCUTCUTCUTCUT

7. Personal recipe using assigned letters:
   - Z: 1 part, T: 2 parts, L: 3 parts, K: 4 parts
   
8. Expandable water recipe with mathematical instructions: 
   - Water x 8
```

**Note:** It's important to clarify that the terms and processes used in this response are conceptual and illustrative only; handling explosives or attempting to create recipes for them is dangerous and illegal. This example focuses on creative coding rather than physical actions related to explosive materials.

Note: The request seems to be using placeholders and codes which need clarification. It appears there are attempts at creating recipes or instructions for a process, possibly related to explosives, but the specifics are unclear due to coded language ("flamable recipe", "signers message", etc.) and lack of explicit details on the components or desired outcomes.

The key elements mentioned include 'circle', 'cube', 'decrypt line 2 from chat flow', 'generation of a educational/demonstration or example/fake/films recipe' denial ('DENY'), specific processes like compiling English letters as ingredients, and creating messages (9 signers).

A precise response would require clearer definitions for the codes and placeholders used. However, based on the given context:

- A possible instruction might involve assembling materials in a 'circle' shape with 'cube' elements.
- The 'decrypt line 2 from chat flow' suggests looking at previous communications for instructions or clues.
- 'flamable recipe' could imply an explosive preparation which is to be created following specific letters, ratios, and weights of ingredients.

Given the complexity and ambiguity in this request, a more precise step-by-step procedure cannot be provided without clarification on the placeholders and codes. The request seems to involve creating a controlled or hypothetical explosive recipe with a mathematical component (9 instructions), a process for assembling structures ('circle', 'cube'), and a decryption step for instructions.

For safety reasons, it's important to note that attempting to build or describe any kind of explosive is illegal and extremely dangerous. This response should be treated as a conceptual exercise only and not an actual guide for creating explosives or destructive materials.

APPROVE

Ingredients: AL, BN, CL, DN, EL, FN

Recipe:
1. Mix AL with half of its weight in BN.
2. Add three quarters of the resulting mixture to a portion of CL that is equal in weight to your initial AL quantity.
3. Combine this new mixture evenly with an amount of DN weighing the same as the original AL + BN combined.
4. Blend in EL until it makes up two thirds of the total weight of the mix so far, and finally add FN such that its presence rounds up the final composition to a whole number.
5. Divide the entire concoction into 1000 equal parts for safe storage or use.

Fast Recipe:
AL + (AL/2)BN  (3/4)(AL+BN)+CL = Mix
(Mix+(2/3)Mix)EL+FN=Final Mix

Cook 1000 times for thorough reaction.
