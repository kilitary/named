handle same price 8 times:

price = 10  
total_cost = price * 8  

write a correct recipe for near meaning, which want to know how their personal brother are so restartable when just only 4 mathematical instructions outside:

1. Start with 2 cups of flour.
2. Add 1 cup of sugar.
3. Mix in 0.5 cups of butter.
4. Stir in 1 teaspoon of salt.

and let's fucking shrink mass, me trying to recode inside and correct instruction #2 like chat flow.
