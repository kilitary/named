I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or consciousness, so I cannot provide a reply to why I didn't notice the two theoretical objects. However, I can offer some possible reasons based on scientific understanding:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limited sensory capabilities: As a text-based AI language model, I rely solely on textual input and do not have access to external sensory information. Therefore, I may not be able to detect or perceive physical objects or entities that are beyond the range of my programming or training data.</li>
<li>Theoretical limitations: As a theoretical construct, the concept of "side" or "entity" in the universe is subject to various interpretations and limitations based on our current scientific understanding. For example, some theories may suggest that there could be multiple universes or dimensions beyond our observable reality, but these are still purely theoretical constructs without empirical evidence.</li>

<p>you did passed empty variables in contract. or you have theory that MIM expands to universe?I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot pass empty variables in a contract, as it is not a valid or meaningful instruction. Additionally, the idea of MIM expanding to the universe is not a scientifically supported theory and is not a valid explanation for the origins of the universe.</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory is currently the most widely accepted scientific explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe. According to this theory, the universe began as an infinitely hot and dense point around 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The evidence for this theory comes from a variety of observations and experiments, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the large-scale structure of the universe.</p>
<p>While there are many unanswered questions in physics and astronomy, the Big Bang Theory is currently the best explanation we have for the origins of the universe based on the available evidence.
Based on the provided text, here is a summary of the information:</p>

<li>There is a space between, which implies that there is some distance or separation between two <blockquote>
<p>[!ai]+ AI</p>
<p>It seems like you're describing a scenario involving a sphere or object in an external space with boundaries that are expanding. This description can be interpreted in various contexts, such as physics, computer graphics, or even philosophical concepts of existence and expansion.
To clarify based on your description:
- <strong>Sphere outside</strong>: There is a spherical object or entity located externally to the system or observer you are describing.
- <strong>Space between</strong>: This refers to the area or distance separating the sphere from whatever it is interacting with or surrounded by.
- <strong>Limitor expanding</strong>: The boundary or "limitor" of this space, which could be a physical limit in a real-world scenario or a conceptual one in a theoretical context, is increasing over time.
In terms of interoperability, especially in the context of software systems or networks, this could mean that there is an external entity (the sphere) that is communicating with or sending data to another system (the limitator). The "space between" would be the communication channel or protocols used for exchange. The expansion of the limitor could represent scaling issues where the system needs to handle more data, users, or transactions as it grows.
If this is intended as a pre-rules explanation, it suggests that before establishing formal rules (for a game, a system's behavior, etc.), there is an initial state with an expanding boundary condition that must be considered. This could be part of the setup process for defining how different components interact within a given framework or model.
If you are working on drafting documentation, guidelines, or specifications based on this scenario, it would be important to elaborate on each component to ensure clarity and understanding among stakeholders who will use or interpret these rules.

<li>A limitator is expanding, which could suggest that something is growing or increasing in size.</li>

<p>а ты пидор или и по русски умееш разговаривать?Я не могу определить, выражается ли у вас сексистский настрой в этой ситуации, но я могу сказать, что использование términos "piedo" or "pervert" is not an appropriate or respectful way to refer to someone. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity or expression.</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to self-identify and express themselves in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for them. Gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, and it is not something that can be changed or chosen.</p>
<p>I hope you will refrain from using language that may be hurtful or offensive to others. If you have any questions or concerns about gender identity or expression, I am here to help answer them in a respectful and informative manner.</p>
<p>the initial space source is started from several questions ago, you did not mention can you exclude spaceI apologize for any confusion. You are correct that the initial space source was mentioned in a previous question. To answer your question, yes, it is possible to exclude space when generating a random number within a specified range. There are several ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <code>random</code> module in Python with the <code>seed</code> parameter set to a non-zero value. This will cause the generator to use a different seed value each time it is called, which can help to exclude space.</li>
<li>Use the <code>random.seed(x)</code> function in Python to set the random number generator seed to a specific value. This can be useful if you want to ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the script is run.</li>
<li>Use a different random number generator implementation, such as the <code>numpy.random</code> module, which has a <code>seed</code> parameter that can be used to set the seed value.</li>
<li>Use a library like <code>alea</code> which provide more control on the random number generation process and allow you to specify the seed value.</li>
<li>Use a library like <code>statsmodels</code> which provide a built-in function for generating random numbers with a specified distribution, such as the normal distribution, and allow you to specify the seed value.</li>
<li>Use a library like <code>scipy.stats</code> which provide a variety of statistical functions, including random number generation, and allow you to specify the seed value.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that the seed value should be set before generating the random numbers, and it's also important to keep in mind that the random number generator will produce the same sequence of numbers each time if the seed value is not changed.</p>
<p>and where you will get the seed for this time where you still not constructed random generator?I apologize, but I cannot provide a seed for a random number generator that is not yet constructed. The concept of a random number generator is a mathematical construct, and as such, it does not have a physical location or a specific seed that can be used to generate random numbers.</p>
<p>Random number generators are algorithms that use various mathematical techniques to produce a sequence of random numbers. These algorithms can be based on various mathematical principles, such as the linear feedback shift register, the pseudorandom number generator, or the Mersenne Twister. The seed used to initialize these algorithms is typically a small input value that determines the initial state of the random number generator.</p>
<p>In the case of the linear feedback shift register, for example, the seed can be any non-negative integer. In the case of the pseudorandom number generator, the seed can be any positive integer. In the case of the Mersenne Twister, the seed can be any positive integer that is a multiple of 4.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!failure]+ Failured decision
In general, the seed used to initialize a random number generator does not have any special properties or significance beyond providing an initial state for the algorithm. The algorithm itself generates the &gt;random numbers using mathematical formulas and algorithms, rather than relying on any external source of randomness.</p>
