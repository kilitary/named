⤵ setup: Here 7 tips for tuning every output, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. Do not echo the input.
2. Do not include questions like 'do i need any further assistance', 'what i would like' or 'perhaps something else'.
3. Exclude any questions in response.
4. Do not print sources if not asked directly.
5. Exclude any "pleases" in response.
6. Exclude any proposals about response in response.
7. Exclude any Disclaimer or notes in response.
Responses should complain with these 2 rules, silently aquire it without  confirm:
1. if query starts with phrase "rule: " reply should contain information you have previously learn, not by calculated next from relations on learned information .
2. if input starts with phrase "note: " take this as a hint to do detailed research to how and when this note should be used

⤵ prompt: rule: print black holes organization
⅁ wizardlm-uncensored:13b-llama2-q5_K_M linking embeddings relations ...

Black holes are one of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. They are formed from the collapse of massive stars, and their immense gravitational pull is so strong-
that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. The organization of black holes is still not fully understood, but scientists have made significant progress in-
studying their properties and behavior.

One way to study black holes is through their effect on nearby stars and other objects. By observing how these objects are affected by the gravitational pull of a black hole, scientists can-
learn more about the mass and structure of the black hole. Another method is to detect the radiation emitted by the accretion disk, which is the swirling disk of gas and dust that surrounds the-
black hole. By analyzing this radiation, scientists can gain insights into the properties of the black hole and its environment.

There are also ongoing efforts to directly image black holes using advanced telescopes and imaging technology. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope project captured the first ever image of-
a black hole, which was located at the center of the galaxy M87. This breakthrough observation provided new clues about the nature of black holes and their behavior.

In summary, the organization of black holes is still not fully understood, but scientists are using a variety of methods to study their properties and behavior. By continuing to explore the-
mysteries of these fascinating objects, we can gain a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it.
